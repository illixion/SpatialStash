# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Hypnos is a visionOS app for Apple Vision Pro that displays images and videos with 2D to 3D spatial photo conversion. It integrates with [Stash](https://stashapp.cc/) media server via GraphQL API, supports local files, and can receive media via the system share sheet.

## Workflow

Always create a git commit at the end of a task, without waiting for the user to ask. Group related changes into a single commit; keep the commit message focused on the "why".

## Build Commands

Run this command to test your changes:
```bash
xcodebuild -quiet -project Hypnos/Hypnos.xcodeproj -scheme Hypnos -destination 'generic/platform=visionOS' build CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

## iOS / iPadOS

The same target builds for iOS 26 (`SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS` covers iphoneos,
iphonesimulator, xros, xrsimulator; device family 1,2,7). Compile check:

```bash
xcodebuild -quiet -project Hypnos/Hypnos.xcodeproj -scheme Hypnos -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' build CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

**Always compile both platforms before committing** — a visionOS-only API is
an iOS build break and vice versa.

How the port is structured (all in `Support/` unless noted):

- **`WindowActions.swift`** — `@OpenWindowProxy` / `@PushWindowProxy` /
  `@DismissWindowProxy` property wrappers replace SwiftUI's
  `@Environment(\.openWindow)` etc. **everywhere**. Call sites keep the
  `openWindow(id:value:)` shape. On visionOS they wrap the real actions; on
  iOS they talk to `IOSWindowRouter`. Never read the raw environment actions
  in shared code — it will not compile on iOS.
- **`IOSWindowRouter.swift`** + **`Views/IOS/IOSRootView.swift`** — iOS has
  one scene. The value-carrying scene ids (`photo-detail`, `video-detail`,
  `shared-photo`, `remote-viewer`, `remote-alert`) become a stack of
  full-screen covers over the gallery; `console`/`gpu-memory`/
  `video-adjustments` become sheets; `main` dismisses back to the gallery.
  Opening a value already on the stack pops back to it (the summon).
  `HypnosApp` declares the visionOS scenes under `#if os(visionOS)`
  and a single `WindowGroup` hosting `IOSRootView` otherwise.
- **`PlatformShims.swift`** — iOS-only same-name stand-ins so shared views
  compile unchanged: `.ornament(...)` → edge overlay (horizontally scrolling
  when wider than the screen), `.glassBackgroundEffect()` → iOS 26
  `.glassEffect`, `.offset(z:)` → no-op, a **null-object
  `ImagePresentationComponent`** (every query answers mono/unsupported, the
  `Spatial3DImage` inits throw) so `PhotoWindowModel`'s 3D code compiles and
  fails closed, and `applySpatialAudioPolicy()` no-ops. Also the two
  cross-platform helpers: **`PlatformCapabilities`** (`supportsSpatial3D`,
  `supportsImmersiveSpaces`, `supportsMultipleWindows`, `supportsStereoVideo`,
  `supportsDiorama`, `supportsWindowResizing` — all false on iOS; shared views
  branch on these to hide controls) and **`WindowGeometry.request(scene,
  size:restriction:animated:)`**, the only way shared code may call
  `requestGeometryUpdate` (`.Vision` preferences don't exist on iOS).
  A bar that wants to know it is being dragged reads the shim's
  `\.ornamentIsScrolling` environment value, published down from the scroller.
  **Never attach a `DragGesture(minimumDistance: 0)` to an ornament bar**: it
  claims the touch at touch-down, the scroll view's pan never begins, and every
  control past the screen edge becomes unreachable (measured on an iPhone 18
  Pro Max, iOS 27 — identical bars scrolled 171pt without it, 0pt with it).
- **Whole-file `#if os(visionOS)` gates** with iOS stubs where other files
  reference the type: `Pseudo3DVideoPlayerView` (stub calls
  `onPlaybackError` so callers fall back to the flat player),
  `StereoscopicVideoView` (stub offers "Play as 2D"), `SlideshowSpatial3DLayer`
  (empty), `ImmersiveVideoView`, `Spatial3DImmersiveView`, `ManagedWindows`,
  `TabBarOrnament`, `HypnosAppIntents`, and `LiftHoverEffect`/
  `ScaleHoverEffect` (degrade to the system pointer hover).
- **`Views/MainTabCatalog.swift`** — which tabs are visible and what the
  slideshow button starts, shared by `TabBarOrnament` (visionOS) and
  `ContentView`'s iOS `TabView` + `Views/IOS/IOSTabToolbar.swift` (library
  switch and slideshow in each tab's navigation bar). The Windows tab is
  hidden on iOS.
- `VideoWindowModel.shouldUse3DMode` / `pseudo3DAvailable` and
  `PhotoWindowModel.switchToViewingMode` / `activate3DMode` /
  `presentAutoRestorePrompt` are fenced by `PlatformCapabilities`, so a
  remembered 3D preference never activates a 3D path on iOS.
- The iOS app icon is `Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset` (a flattened
  composite of the visionOS layer stack, which keeps the same `AppIcon` name).
- `HypnosUITests` stays visionOS-only.

## tvOS

The same target builds for tvOS 26.2+ (`SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS` adds appletvos,
appletvsimulator; device family adds `3`, alongside iOS/iPadOS's `1,2,7`).
Compile check:

```bash
xcodebuild -project Hypnos/Hypnos.xcodeproj -target Hypnos -sdk appletvos \
  SDKROOT=appletvos SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS='appletvos appletvsimulator' \
  TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY=3 TVOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=26.2 CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO \
  SYMROOT=<scratch dir> build
```

**Always compile all three platforms before committing.** tvOS is the
strictest of the three SDKs here — several APIs the iOS build happily links
(`Slider`, `DatePicker`, `DisclosureGroup`, `popover`, `.textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)`,
`UIPasteboard`, `Gauge`, `navigationBarTitleDisplayMode`, `DragGesture`,
`UIActivityViewController`, `FileDocument`/`fileExporter`/`fileImporter`,
`WebKit` at all) are unavailable on tvOS, and the whole shared module
(views the tvOS UI never presents included) has to compile as one target.

### Root UI: a real Apple TV app, not a squeezed iPad UI

`Views/TV/` is a from-scratch root, selected in `HypnosApp` for `os(tvOS)`
(`TVRootView`, a `WindowGroup` alongside iOS's), built for a Siri Remote and
the focus engine — it shares data (`AppModel.galleryImages`/`galleryVideos`,
`MediaContainer`, `FilmSession`) with the visionOS/iOS screens but reuses
almost none of their views, whose gestures and chrome are touch/gaze-shaped:

- **`TVRootView`** — a plain `TabView`, which tvOS renders as the platform's
  own top tab bar with no ornament or custom chrome needed. Five tabs:
  Pictures, Videos, Albums, Films, Settings (`TVTab.swift`, a small tvOS-only
  enum — not an extra case on the shared `Tab`, which is keyed to
  `RAVEA11y`/`RAVETabItem` and the visionOS/iOS developer-tab rules). No
  Windows tab (one scene, nothing to summon), no Filters tab, no Remote/
  Console developer tabs.
- **`TVPicturesTabView` / `TVVideosTabView`** — `LazyVGrid` over the same
  source/filter/pagination the visionOS/iOS grids use
  (`loadInitialGallery`/`loadNextPage`/`hasMorePages`, and the `Videos`
  equivalents). Cells are plain `Button`s styled `.buttonStyle(.card)` for
  the standard tvOS focus lift — no custom hover/press gesture code, unlike
  `GalleryThumbnailView`'s long-press-to-QuickLook handling (touch-only).
  Thumbnails load through the existing `MediaThumbnail` view
  (`Views/MediaThumbnail.swift`), already gesture-free and cross-platform.
- **`TVPhotoViewerView`** — fullscreen image. Siri Remote left/right
  (`.onMoveCommand`) move prev/next, Play/Pause (`.onPlayPauseCommand`) starts
  or stops a slideshow timer, Menu (`.onExitCommand`) dismisses. None of
  `PhotoDisplayView`'s rendering tiers, adjustments or 3D modes are reused.
- **`TVVideoPlayerView`** — `AVPlayerViewController` via
  `UIViewControllerRepresentable`. **There is no WebKit fallback on tvOS** —
  WebKit doesn't exist there at all — but it still follows the same two
  moves every other AVFoundation path in the app makes before opening a URL:
  a `photos-asset:///` identity resolves through `PhotosAssetStore` first;
  every other source runs through `NativeVideoDecodeProbe.canPlayNatively`
  (which is what the VP9 supplemental decoder below actually unlocks — VP9
  *inside an MP4* can decode, but the WebM *container* still can't) and
  falls back to Stash's HLS transcode (`GalleryVideo.transcodeStreamURL`) —
  the *only* fallback tier here, unlike the two-tier native/WebKit split
  visionOS and iOS get — when it can't; a source with neither simply reports
  it can't play rather than showing a stuck black screen. Every URL goes
  through `MediaAuthorization.shared.asset(for:)`/`authorizedURL(_:)` so a
  Stash server behind a login authenticates like everywhere else in the app
  (see "Auth" below). DEBUG-only `tvAutoOpenPictureIndex=N` /
  `tvAutoPlayVideoIndex=N` launch args (mirroring `tvInitialTab`) open a
  specific gallery item's viewer/player immediately, since there is no other
  way to drive a tap into either view for testing this path.
- **`TVAlbumsTabView`** — the same `MediaContainer` grid and
  `AppModel.applyContainer(_:isVideo:)` the visionOS/iOS Albums tab uses;
  switches the tab selection to Pictures/Videos afterward instead of a
  window-model field. **Local's nested folder browser
  (`LocalFolderBrowserView`) isn't ported** — built for pointer/touch
  up/down-a-folder-stack taps — so Local shows a placeholder directing back
  to Pictures/Videos instead. Known gap.
- **`TVFilmsTabView`** — Jellyfin search over the existing `FilmSession`,
  presenting `FilmPlayerView` unchanged. `FilmPlayerView` already has a real
  `#elseif os(tvOS)` branch (added alongside the visionOS/iOS ones): the
  picture only, no `FilmStageView`, and a `Slider`-free transport
  (`TVFilmTransport`, `Views/FilmPlayer/FilmPlayerView.swift`).
  **Atmos object audio is out of scope on tvOS and is a known gap**: the
  object-audio engine (`RAVEFilm`'s `AtmosObjectAudio`) needs headphone or
  AVP head tracking to place objects around a listener, which means nothing
  for a TV pointed at a fixed listening position, and a real
  speaker-array/soundbar passthrough is a separate project. The tvOS branch
  never mounts `FilmStageView` at all, so nothing ever consumes
  `FilmPlayer.audio` — a film with Atmos objects plays its picture in
  silence rather than through any real or fake spatialisation.
- **`TVSettingsView`** — a remote-friendly subset of `SettingsTabView`:
  library source, Stash server + test connection, a Local Files note,
  `NextcloudSettingsSection` and `CacheSettingsSection` reused verbatim
  (neither uses a `Slider` or anything else touch-only). No display
  adjustments, depth models, or Backup import/export (no Files app on tvOS
  to pick a file from or save one to). `Packages/NextcloudMedia/Package.swift`
  now declares `.tvOS(.v26)` (2026-09-24) — an undeclared platform gets
  SwiftPM's ancient default deployment floor, not an excluded one, so
  linking the package from the tvOS target needs the explicit entry.
- **Default library source** (`AppModel.defaultTVLibrarySource`, `#if
  os(tvOS)`) — applied only when nothing is persisted yet (a fresh install):
  Stash if configured, else Nextcloud, else Photos when it's actually
  readable, else Local. This is tvOS-only because the general default
  (`.stash`) predates the setting and exists only to keep an *existing*
  non-tv install's behavior unchanged — tvOS has no such installed base
  to preserve, and Apple TV commonly has no iCloud Photos library at all
  (see Known gaps), so landing a fresh install on an empty, denied Photos
  tab would be a worse first impression than Local. A choice, once made
  (including the user's own), is still persisted exactly as before.
- **Photos on tvOS** — every `PHImageManager` request in
  `PhotosAssetStore` already sets `isNetworkAccessAllowed = true` (images,
  thumbnails, video) regardless of platform, since tvOS keeps almost
  nothing locally and every one of those requests may need to pull from
  iCloud Photos; no tvOS-specific change was needed there. What tvOS did
  need is **`TVPhotosLibraryStateView`** (`Views/TV/`) — the Pictures/Videos
  tabs' empty state when the Photos source is undetermined, denied, or
  genuinely empty, with the fix named explicitly ("enable iCloud Photos in
  Settings → Users and Accounts → iCloud on this Apple TV") rather than the
  visionOS/iOS `PhotoLibraryStateView`'s touch-shaped inline server form.
- **VP9 decoding**: `HypnosApp.init` calls
  `VTRegisterSupplementalVideoDecoderIfAvailable(kCMVideoCodecType_VP9)` once,
  guarded `#available(tvOS 26.2, *)`, matching the spike in
  `TVLab/FilmLabTV/YouTubeLab.swift`. Without it AVFoundation can't decode the
  WebM/VP9 sources Stash/Jellyfin commonly serve — there is no WebKit
  fallback to decode them another way.
- A DEBUG-only launch argument opens `TVRootView` straight to a given tab —
  `-UITest -UITestDefault tvInitialTab=Videos` — reusing the existing
  `-UITestDefault key=value` mechanism (`Support/UITestingConfiguration.swift`)
  rather than inventing a second one. This exists because there is no XCUITest
  driving tvOS (`HypnosUITests` stays visionOS-only, see below) and `simctl`
  has no remote-button injection of its own, so it was the only way to get
  every tab in front of a screenshot.

### Auth (all platforms, found via tvOS testing)

"Authenticate every AVFoundation path" (commit ea220b7, `MediaAuthorization`)
holds on tvOS the same way it does everywhere else — `TVVideoPlayerView`
builds its `AVURLAsset` through `MediaAuthorization.shared.asset(for:)` — but
testing it against `scripts/dev-stash.sh auth` (below) surfaced a real,
**pre-existing, all-platform** bug: `StashAPIClient.query` unconditionally
sent `Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>` for a plain Stash API key, which real
Stash's session middleware (`pkg/session.ApiKeyHeader`/`ApiKeyParameter` in
Stash's own source) rejects outright with a 401 — verified directly against
the dev instance (`ApiKey: <key>` header and `?apikey=` query param both
succeed; `Authorization: Bearer <key>` is a flat 401). `MediaAuthorization`
itself already had this right (`updateStashMediaCredential` registers
`.queryParam(name: "apikey", …)` for a plain key), so **stream/image URLs
worked while every GraphQL browse call silently 401'd** — this is exactly
what "the owner's real Stash now requires login" would have hit on any
platform, not just tvOS. Fixed to mirror `updateStashMediaCredential`'s two
cases: a plain key now sends the `ApiKey` header; a manually-pasted
`Bearer …` value (the existing escape hatch for a reverse proxy in front of
Stash — Cloudflare Access, Authelia, …) still goes out verbatim as
`Authorization`.

`scripts/dev-stash.sh auth [user pass]` (default `dev`/`dev`) turns login on
for the dev instance — `configureGeneral(username:password:)`, a form-POST
to `/login` for a session cookie, then `generateAPIKey` — so the app's
authenticated path has something to test against. The key is written to
`$root/config/dev-api-key.txt` and **never printed**; read it from that file
when configuring a test run (e.g. `-UITestDefault stashAPIKey=$(cat …)`).
That launch argument round-trips through `KeychainStore`'s existing
UserDefaults→Keychain migration (`AppModel.init` already calls
`KeychainStore.migrateFromUserDefaults(legacyKey: "stashAPIKey", …)` before
reading it) — no new plumbing needed, but the app's build **must be signed**
(the default ad-hoc simulator signing is enough; `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
is not) or every Keychain call fails with `errSecMissingEntitlement`
(-34018), silently leaving the API key unset.

### What's excluded, and why (capability flags + fencing)

`PlatformCapabilities` (`Support/PlatformShims.swift`) — visionOS-only
still means visionOS-only on tvOS: `supportsSpatial3D`,
`supportsImmersiveSpaces`, `supportsMultipleWindows`, `supportsStereoVideo`
(the windowed-stereo pseudo-3D pipeline — meaningless on a flat TV even
though it needs no immersive space) and `supportsWindowResizing` are all
false there, exactly as they already are on iOS; shared views that branch on
them need no tvOS-specific change. `deviceFamilyName` adds an `Apple TV`
case.

Whole-file or whole-feature `#if !os(tvOS)` fences, mirroring the iOS
pattern above:

- **MV-HEVC stereoscopic conversion** — `MVHEVCConverter.swift`,
  `ChunkBufferManager.swift`, `StereoscopicVideoPlayer.swift`. visionOS-immersive
  only; their caller (`StereoscopicVideoView`) was already `#if os(visionOS)`
  with an iOS stub, so nothing else needed to change.
- **Settings → Backup** (`SettingsBackupDocument`'s `FileDocument`
  conformance, and the `fileExporter`/`fileImporter`/`.settingsBackupImport`
  call sites in `SettingsTabView.swift` and `SettingsBackupImport.swift`) —
  no Files app / document picker on tvOS.
- **The Share button** (`ActivityViewController`/`ActivityHostController` in
  `Services/ShareSheetHelper.swift`, and its call sites in
  `PhotoOrnamentView`/`VideoOrnamentsView`) — no `UIActivityViewController`
  on tvOS, no AirDrop/Files/Messages target for a Siri Remote UX to hand a
  file to either.
- **WebKit-only files** (already `#if canImport(WebKit)` since commit
  f4f914e: the web video player, animated GIF/WebP/JXL views, pinned web
  pages, WebM thumbnails) — every *caller* of the types they declare
  (`PhotoDisplayView`'s animated-image tiers, `RemoteViewerWindowView`,
  `VideoWindowView`, `VideoQuickLookView`, `ThumbnailGenerator`'s WebM poster
  path, `RemoteViewerSceneRoot`'s web-page mode) is gated the same way, with
  a Metal/native fallback or a static first frame in place of the animation.
  **There is no WebKit fallback on tvOS, full stop** — an animated
  GIF/WebP/JXL shows its first decoded frame rather than animating, and a
  video whose format needs WebKit to decode simply doesn't play.

`Support/PlatformShims.swift` gained same-name stand-ins so the touch-only
SwiftUI list above compiles out of call sites that belong to visionOS/iOS-only
screens, without duplicating those views:

- `.selectableText()` → `.textSelection(.enabled)` elsewhere, no-op on tvOS.
- `.roundedTextFieldStyle()` → `.textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)` elsewhere,
  `.textFieldStyle(.plain)` on tvOS.
- `.popover(isPresented:content:)`, `#if os(tvOS)`-only overload standing in
  as a `.sheet` — scoped to exactly the shape every call site uses so it
  can't shadow or ambiguate SwiftUI's real (defaulted-parameter) `popover` on
  iOS/visionOS.
- `platformDisclosureGroup(content:label:)` (a free function, not a `View`
  extension — `DisclosureGroup` is a concrete type used as a value, not a
  modifier chained off `self`) — the real `DisclosureGroup` elsewhere, an
  always-expanded `VStack` on tvOS.
- `hidesStatusBar` gained a tvOS branch (no status bar there either, nothing
  to hide) alongside its existing visionOS/iOS ones.

Remaining `Slider`/`DatePicker`/`DragGesture`/`Gauge`/
`navigationBarTitleDisplayMode`/`UIPasteboard` call sites are wrapped
`#if !os(tvOS)` individually at each site (`FiltersTabView`,
`RemoteTabView`, `VisualAdjustmentsPopover`, `Video3DSettingsSheet`,
`GPUMemoryMonitorView`, `VideoControlBar`, `MediaDetailSheet`,
`DepthCacheSettingsView`/`DepthPipelineSpikeSection`, `ContentView`,
`Views/IOS/IOSRootView.swift`) — all belong to visionOS/iOS-only screens the
tvOS root UI never presents, so the tvOS branch is dead code kept only to
satisfy the compiler. `CacheBudget.volumeStats()` falls back to the plain
`volumeAvailableCapacityKey` on tvOS (`volumeAvailableCapacityForImportantUsageKey`
doesn't exist there).

### Known gaps

- **Atmos object audio** (Films tab) — see above; films play picture-only,
  silently, on tvOS.
- **Local library folder browsing** (Albums tab) — not ported; Local shows a
  placeholder on tvOS.
- **Animated GIF/WebP/JXL** — render as a static first frame, not animated
  (no WebKit).
- **Photos as a library source** may have little or nothing to show on a TV
  that has never had a personal camera roll in the way iOS/visionOS do;
  Stash and Local remain the practical sources. It works end to end when
  iCloud Photos *is* on for the signed-in account (network access is always
  allowed — see above), and the empty/denied states point at
  Settings → Users and Accounts → iCloud rather than showing a bare "no
  photos" message.
- **tvOS has no XCUITest coverage.** `HypnosUITests` stays visionOS-only
  (see below); the DEBUG launch-argument tab selector above is the only
  automated hook into the tvOS UI so far.

### Icon

`Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.brandassets` — tvOS's layered-image-stack format
(`App Icon.imagestack`, three fully-opaque Front/Middle/Back layers — a
partially-transparent layer fails validation — plus a `Top Shelf Image`),
derived from the same flattened 1024×1024 source the iOS `AppIcon.appiconset`
uses. A simple, valid set; no per-layer parallax art was made.

## macOS

Native SwiftUI on macOS 26 (`SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS` adds `macosx`,
`MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 26.0`) — not Catalyst, not Designed-for-iPad.
Compile check:

```bash
xcodebuild -quiet -project Hypnos/Hypnos.xcodeproj -scheme Hypnos -destination 'generic/platform=macOS' build CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

Sandboxed (`Hypnos/Hypnos.entitlements`, wired only for macOS via
`"CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS[sdk=macosx*]"` — iOS/tvOS/visionOS still ship with no
entitlements file at all): `app-sandbox`, `network.client` (Stash/Nextcloud),
`files.user-selected.read-write` (Settings → Backup's `fileExporter`/
`fileImporter`, which — unlike tvOS — already works unmodified on macOS under
sandbox with this entitlement). The app icon's `AppIcon.appiconset` gained a
`mac` idiom (16→512pt, 1x/2x) alongside the existing iOS `universal` entry,
generated from the same flattened 1024×1024 source as the other platforms —
square, no rounded-square mask baked in (a cosmetic gap, same spirit as
tvOS's "no per-layer parallax art was made").

### Shape: real multiple windows, a sidebar, a menu bar

macOS gets **real multiple windows**, like visionOS — not the iOS/tvOS
single-scene router. `HypnosApp.macOSScenes` mirrors visionOS's scene *set*
(main window, `photo-detail`, `video-detail`, Film Player, Console, GPU
Memory) but deliberately not its scene *content*: visionOS's `photo-detail`/
`video-detail` windows host `PhotoDisplayView`/`VideoWindowView`, which pull
in the full RealityKit/fake-3D/adjustments machinery and several UIKit-
specific representables (see "UIKit gaps" below) that this pass didn't port.
So macOS gets its own lightweight window content instead — the same choice
tvOS made for its viewers, and for the same reason (a squeezed port of
gaze/touch-shaped chrome is worse than a small platform-native one):

- **`Views/Mac/MacRootView.swift`** — the main window's root. A
  `NavigationSplitView` sidebar (`MacTab`: Pictures, Videos, Albums, Films,
  Settings — same five sections as `TVTab`, same reasoning: no Windows tab,
  nothing to summon from a single main window yet; no Filters tab, nothing to
  filter by) in place of visionOS/iOS's `TabBarOrnament`/`TabView`.
- **`MacPicturesView.swift`** / **`MacVideosView.swift`** — grids over
  `appModel.galleryImages`/`galleryVideos`, the same source/filter/pagination
  every platform uses. Clicking a cell opens a **real, separate window**
  (`openWindow(id: "photo-detail"/"video-detail", value:)`) — the ordinary
  Mac convention, not a push-in-place or a cover.
- **`MacPhotoViewerWindow.swift`** — the `photo-detail` window: a plain
  `Image(nsImage:)` fed by `ImageLoader` (so the same `MediaAuthorization` as
  every other platform). No adjustments, no 3D.
- **`MacVideoPlayerWindow.swift`** — the `video-detail` window: a direct
  `NSViewRepresentable` over AppKit's `AVPlayerView` (see "UIKit gaps"
  below for why not SwiftUI's `VideoPlayer`), following the same
  auth-then-decode-probe-then-transcode-fallback sequence as
  `TVVideoPlayerView` (see tvOS's "Auth" section) — VP9 is registered as a
  supplemental decoder at launch on macOS too (`HypnosApp.init`), so
  VP9-in-MP4 may decode natively; VP9-in-WebM still needs the transcode,
  since WebKit isn't wired up on macOS this pass. Verified against the dev
  Stash instance: the H.264 clip plays natively through a real `AVPlayerView`
  (timecode advancing, genuine `AVAudioSession`/`FigPlayer` activity in the
  log) — the VP9 fallback path itself wasn't independently re-verified on
  macOS, since `NativeVideoDecodeProbe`/`MediaAuthorization` are the exact
  same shared code already proven on tvOS.
- **`MacAlbumsView.swift`** — same `MediaContainer` grid as tvOS's, minus
  Local's nested folder browser (known gap, same as tvOS).
- **`MacFilmsView.swift`** — Jellyfin search over the same `FilmSession`;
  opens the film in its own "Film Player" window rather than a cover/sheet
  (macOS has no `fullScreenCover`).
- **`MacSettingsView.swift`** — library source, Stash server + test
  connection, `NextcloudSettingsSection` and `CacheSettingsSection` reused
  verbatim (same as tvOS — neither needed any change for a third platform).
- **`HypnosCommands.swift`** — the menu bar (`.commands` on the main
  `WindowGroup`): File → New Window, a Library menu with one item per
  `MacTab` plus Play/Pause (space bar). Tab selection and play/pause both go
  through `NotificationCenter` (`.hypnosSelectTab`/`.hypnosTogglePlayPause`)
  rather than shared `@State`, because a `.commands` closure belongs to the
  app, not to one scene instance, and has no handle on a specific window's
  view state — the ordinary AppKit pattern for routing a menu action to
  whichever window is key. With more than one main or video window open, all
  of them react, which is an accepted simplification for this pass.

**Not reused: `RAVEWindowSessionRegistry`/`RAVEWindowManagerView`
("Windows tab" style management) and `AppDelegate`'s main-window-summon
logic** — `AppDelegate.swift` gets its own `#if os(macOS)` branch
(`NSApplicationDelegate`, just the local-media/shared-cache launch
housekeeping) rather than calling `RAVEWindowSessionRegistry.shared.
ensureMainWindowVisible()` the iOS/visionOS branch does. Known gap, not a
compatibility problem: RAVEUI already builds for macOS (Longwave's Mac app
links it), but wiring Hypnos's macOS windows through the shared registry
wasn't attempted this pass — ordinary AppKit window restoration (Cmd+N, the
Dock icon) covers "how do I get a window back" well enough for a first port.

### UIKit gaps: the seam files

Shared code uses `UIImage`, `UIPasteboard`, `UIActivityViewController`,
`UIDevice`, `UIViewRepresentable`/`UIViewControllerRepresentable`
(`MetalImageView` over `MTKView`, the native video views,
`AVPlayerViewController`), none of which exist without UIKit. One seam file
per concern, in `Support/`, plus a handful of `#if os(macOS)` branches at the
handful of call sites each gap actually reaches:

- **`Support/PlatformImage.swift`** — `PlatformImage` is the typealias new
  macOS-aware code should use (`UIImage` on UIKit platforms, `NSImage` on
  macOS). But the file *also* aliases `UIImage = NSImage` on macOS, so the
  **226 existing `UIImage` call sites across ~30 files keep compiling
  unchanged** — renaming every one of them to `PlatformImage` would have been
  exactly the "scattered edits" these seams exist to avoid. An `NSImage`
  extension adds the handful of UIKit-isms those call sites actually use
  that `NSImage` lacks natively: `.cgImage`, `.scale`, `.imageOrientation`
  (mirroring `UIImage.Orientation`'s cases/raw values exactly, since shared
  code switches over them), `pngData()`, `jpegData(compressionQuality:)`,
  `init(cgImage:)`/`init(cgImage:scale:orientation:)`, and a no-op
  `byPreparingForDisplay()` (a Core Animation pre-decode hint with no AppKit
  equivalent). `.scale`/`.imageOrientation` are stored via associated
  objects (`nonisolated(unsafe)` keys — they're pointer-identity keys for
  `objc_get/setAssociatedObject`, never actually mutated as data, so Swift 6's
  shared-mutable-state check is a false positive here). Also adds
  `Image(platformImage:)`, since SwiftUI's `Image(uiImage:)`/`Image(nsImage:)`
  are two different initializers with two different argument labels despite
  the type being the same via the alias — the ~15 call sites that build an
  `Image` from a loaded `PlatformImage` go through this one spelling instead
  of branching at each site. **Known gap:** `NSImage`'s bottom-left-origin,
  resolution-independent coordinate system means pixel-exact parity with
  iOS/visionOS (especially anything orientation-sensitive) is unverified —
  this seam buys compilation and the common decode/encode paths, not a
  guarantee every transform produces identical output.
- **`Support/PlatformPasteboard.swift`** — macOS-only `UIPasteboard.general`
  stand-in (backed by `NSPasteboard`) with the same settable-`.string` shape,
  so the two existing `#if !os(tvOS)` "Copy" call sites
  (`MediaDetailSheet`, `DepthPipelineSpikeSection`) needed no change.
- **`PlatformWindowScene`** (in `Support/PlatformShims.swift`) — stand-in for
  `UIWindowScene`, which macOS has no equivalent object for at all (a
  `Window`/`WindowGroup` scene maps straight to a real `NSWindow`, no
  delegate in between). Never actually instantiated on macOS; exists purely
  so `SceneDelegate`, `WindowGeometry`/`WindowResizeCoalescer`/
  `WindowSizeNudge` and the several `resolvedWindowScene` properties
  (`GalleryGridView`, `PhotoDisplayView`, `VideoWindowView`,
  `LocalFolderBrowserView`, `RemoteViewerWindowView`) have a type to compile
  against. This costs nothing functionally: `WindowGeometry.request` was
  *already* a no-op on iOS and tvOS (only visionOS's branch does anything
  with the scene it's handed), so macOS joining that no-op list is exactly
  consistent, not a new limitation. `effectiveGeometrySize` replaces every
  direct `.effectiveGeometry.coordinateSpace.bounds.size` call so the same
  spelling reads on every platform.
- **`Support/WindowActions.swift`** — macOS now shares visionOS's branch (the
  real `OpenWindowAction`/`DismissWindowAction`), not iOS/tvOS's
  `IOSWindowRouter` branch, since it has real windows too. `pushWindow` has
  no macOS equivalent at all (visionOS-only API: "replace this window's
  content in place"), so a push on macOS just opens a new window — the
  ordinary Mac convention is separate windows, not one that swaps content.
- **`Delegates/SceneDelegate.swift` / `AppDelegate.swift`** — each gets a
  `#if os(macOS)` branch. `SceneDelegate`'s cross-platform static pieces (the
  cold-launch shared-URL backlog `IncomingURLHandler` reads on every
  platform) moved into a plain `extension SceneDelegate` so both branches
  share them without duplicating; the macOS branch itself just carries a
  `weak var windowScene: PlatformWindowScene?` and none of the real
  `UIWindowSceneDelegate` lifecycle methods, which don't apply. See "Not
  reused" above for why `AppDelegate`'s macOS branch skips
  `RAVEWindowSessionRegistry`.
- **`MetalImageView.swift` / `NativeMetalVideoPlayerView.swift`** —
  **stubbed on macOS**, not ported. Both are already real
  `UIViewRepresentable`s (nothing visionOS-only in either — they already
  compile and run on iOS unchanged), and both have essentially zero other
  UIKit surface: the fix would have been small and mechanical (a second
  wrapper struct with `makeNSView`/`updateNSView` instead of `makeUIView`/
  `updateUIView`, sharing the exact same `Coordinator` — MTKView/AVPlayer/
  Metal setup code is already fully cross-platform). Not done this pass
  because nothing in `Views/Mac/` mounts either view (the Mac photo/video
  windows use plain `Image(nsImage:)` and `AVPlayerView` instead — see
  above) — a real, bounded upgrade for later, not a platform limitation.
- **WKWebView-based views — also stubbed, for the same "nothing calls it"
  reason, but with a real platform-API wrinkle**: `AnimatedImageWebView`,
  `AnimatedJXLWebView`, `WebVideoPlayerView`, `PinnedWebPageView` (+
  `WebPageWindowModel`/`WebPageWindowView`/`WebPageOrnamentView`, whose sole
  caller is one of the above). Their transparent-background/no-scroll setup
  (`webView.isOpaque`, `.backgroundColor`, `.scrollView.*`) is UIKit-`WKWebView`
  API with **no macOS equivalent property** (macOS's `WKWebView` has no
  `.scrollView` at all, and no public `drawsBackground`-style toggle either —
  the well-known workaround is an undocumented `setValue(_:forKey:
  "drawsBackground")` KVC call). WebKit itself is fully available on macOS
  (Raven already proves `WKWebView` works fine there) and none of these gates
  block that — they're stubs (fail-closed: `onError`/`onSourceUnplayable`
  fire immediately so a caller's fallback chain still does something
  sensible) pending a real `NSViewRepresentable` with the KVC workaround.
  Known gap, tracked here rather than silently degraded.
- **Small, scattered `#if !os(macOS)` fences** at the handful of call sites
  each of these needs, mirroring the existing tvOS pattern exactly:
  `.hoverEffect`/`.hoverEffectDisabled()` (no pointer-hover concept on
  macOS's real cursor the way iPad's trackpad pointer needs help — `.hoverEffect`
  is unavailable there outright), `.keyboardType`/`.textInputAutocapitalization`
  (soft-keyboard-only, meaningless with a physical keyboard),
  `.navigationBarTitleDisplayMode`/`ToolbarItemPlacement.topBarLeading`/
  `.topBarTrailing`/`.toolbarVisibility(for: .tabBar)` (iOS/tvOS-only
  placements), `AVAudioSession` (no per-app audio-session category system on
  macOS — `AudioSessionConfig.configureMixedPlayback()` no-ops there),
  `os_proc_available_memory()` (iOS/tvOS/visionOS jetsam telemetry, no macOS
  equivalent — `DeviceMetrics` reports 0 for `availableMB` there),
  `UIBackgroundTaskIdentifier`/`UIApplication.beginBackgroundTask`
  (`RemoteViewerModel`'s background-flush assertion — macOS apps aren't
  suspended when backgrounded the way iOS ones are, so there's nothing to
  hold open), `UIAccessibility.isReduceMotionEnabled`/
  `reduceMotionStatusDidChangeNotification` → `NSWorkspace.shared.
  accessibilityDisplayShouldReduceMotion`/`accessibilityDisplayOptionsDidChangeNotification`,
  `UIApplication.openSettingsURLString` → `x-apple.systempreferences:` (only
  reachable from `MediaLibraryStateView`'s visionOS/iOS Photos-denied screen,
  which the Mac UI doesn't use — a generic System Settings open rather than a
  crash). `IOSRootView.swift`/`IOSTabToolbar.swift`/`ContentView.swift`'s
  iOS `TabView` branch and `ShareSheetHelper.swift`'s `ActivityViewController`
  are excluded from macOS entirely (`#if !os(visionOS) && !os(macOS)` /
  `#if !os(tvOS) && !os(macOS)`) — dead code kept compiling only to satisfy
  the whole-module build, exactly like they already are on tvOS. **Share is a
  known gap on macOS**: `NSSharingServicePicker` would be the real
  replacement; not implemented this pass since nothing in the Mac UI offers a
  Share button yet.

### Films

`FilmPlayerView` gained a third content branch (`#elseif os(iOS)` for the
existing AirPods-head-tracking Form, `#else` for macOS) rather than falling
into the old iOS-shaped `#else` unconditionally: `HeadphoneHeadTracker` is
iOS-only (AirPods motion), so macOS plays the film's picture **and its Atmos
object audio**, just without head tracking — `RAVEFilm`'s `FilmStageView`
already documents itself as supporting exactly this ("iOS and macOS: a
virtual camera") and its `listenerOrientation` parameter defaults to
identity, which *is* "no tracking": the sound stage stays fixed relative to
the picture. No RAVESDK changes were needed. Films weren't tested end-to-end
this pass (no dev Jellyfin instance, same constraint as every other
platform) — verified compile and the Settings/Films UI only.

### A real SwiftUI bug: `VideoPlayer` crashes, `AVPlayerView` doesn't

`MacVideoPlayerWindow` wraps AppKit's `AVPlayerView` directly via a small
`NSViewRepresentable` rather than using SwiftUI's own `VideoPlayer(player:)`
(which wraps the same class internally). `VideoPlayer` crashed at launch on
this Xcode 27 / macOS 26 pairing every time, with `failed to demangle
superclass of VideoPlayerView from mangled name 'So12AVPlayerViewC': unknown
error` — a Swift runtime metadata bug in SwiftUI's own wrapper type, not
anything in this app. Going one layer down to the AppKit class directly
(`makeNSView`/`updateNSView` on a plain `NSViewRepresentable`) avoids
whatever synthesized type trips it, and is arguably the more idiomatic Mac
choice anyway — it's the seam the task's own UIKit-gap notes named
(`AVPlayerView` on macOS). Revisit `VideoPlayer` on a later Xcode/macOS if
this app ever wants its convenience over the representable.

### Reusable pattern, for the next app to go cross-platform

The shape that generalizes: **one seam file per concern in `Support/`**
(`PlatformImage`, `PlatformPasteboard`, `PlatformWindowScene`), each
providing either a typealias bridging the two platforms' types plus an
extension filling the gap (`PlatformImage`), or a macOS-only stand-in with
the same call shape as the UIKit type it replaces (`PlatformPasteboard`,
`PlatformWindowScene`). **`WindowActions.swift`'s three-way branch**
(visionOS real actions / macOS real actions / iOS-tvOS router) is the
template for "does this platform have real multi-window or not" — check
`PlatformCapabilities.supportsMultipleWindows`-style booleans before
reaching for a router. **Stub, don't port, a UIKit-`Representable` view
nothing on the new platform mounts yet** — `MetalImageView`,
`NativeMetalVideoPlayerView` and the WKWebView family show the pattern:
confirm the real fix is small (usually just the wrapper struct's protocol
conformance, never the shared `Coordinator`) before spending the time: if
nothing calls it, a stub buys compilation now and the real port stays a
scoped, well-understood follow-up. **Give the new platform its own root
under `Views/<Platform>/`** rather than reusing the touch/gaze-shaped one —
tvOS proved this first (`TVRootView`), macOS confirms it generalizes
(`MacRootView`): a NavigationSplitView sidebar is exactly as
platform-appropriate as a `TabView` was for tvOS, and porting the ornament
instead would have dragged in everything the seam list above had to stub.

## UI Tests (XCUITest)

```bash
./scripts/run-ui-tests.sh                                   # whole suite, ~3.5 min
./scripts/run-ui-tests.sh WelcomeFlowUITests                # one class
./scripts/run-ui-tests.sh WelcomeFlowUITests/testSkipDismissesTheFlowAndLandsInTheApp
```

`HypnosUITests` is the app's only test target and exists because **XCUITest is
the only way to drive a visionOS app's UI**: `simctl` has no tap/swipe/scroll
subcommand of any kind, so the alternative is coordinate math against a screenshot
through `macos-control`, one Touch ID prompt per session, and gestures the simulator
handles badly. XCUITest is accessibility-driven, needs no coordinates, and runs
headless. The script exists mainly to keep `-collect-test-diagnostics never` on every
invocation — without it a *passing* run hangs for exactly 600 s afterwards (see
`~/Projects/CLAUDE.md`).

Three pieces make it work:

- **`Shared/AccessibilityIdentifiers.swift` is a member of both targets.** It is the
  one file in the project referenced explicitly in `project.pbxproj` rather than
  picked up by the synchronized folder group, and that is the point: a test target
  shares no module with the app, so identifiers otherwise get written twice and the
  copy in the test target rots. Shared-component identifiers come from RAVEUI's
  `RAVEA11y` instead, which both targets link — a tab is `rave.tab.<enum case name>`,
  deliberately the case name rather than the display title, which is mid-rename.
- **`Support/UITestingConfiguration.swift`** applies `-UITestDefault key=value` launch
  arguments to UserDefaults before `AppModel.init` reads them (hence
  `HypnosApp.init` being written out rather than using a property default —
  a default value expression would run first). DEBUG-only, so a release build has no
  launch arguments that rewrite settings.
- **`AppLauncher.baseline` states the flags every test reads.** Resetting the defaults
  domain is not sufficient on the simulator: `cfprefsd` serves values that survive
  both `removeObject(forKey:)` and `removePersistentDomain(forName:)` — measured with
  `persistentDomain` returning empty, no plist on the device containing the key, and
  `bool(forKey:)` still returning `true` on the next line. Any new test that depends
  on a persisted flag must declare it via `defaults:` rather than assume a wipe.

Two things worth knowing before writing more:

- **Identify containers with `.accessibilityElement(children: .contain)`.** SwiftUI
  only puts a group in the accessibility tree when asked, so a bare
  `.accessibilityIdentifier` on a `VStack` attaches to nothing and the test cannot see
  it. `app.anyElement(id)` then avoids also having to guess which element *type* the
  view mapped onto.
- **Spatial 3D generation is device-only.** In the simulator it fails with
  `Spatial3DImageError error 9`, so the welcome sample's conversion test asserts the
  designed fallback (back to the flat photo, Convert offered again) rather than
  success. Anything else touching `ImagePresentationComponent` needs the same shape.

Not yet covered: any window actually *listed* in the Windows tab, which needs a
pop-out, which needs media. Seeding that is `simctl addmedia` plus
`simctl privacy grant photos` from outside the test process — harness work for
`run-ui-tests.sh`, not a gap in the app.

## Architecture

### App Structure
- **HypnosApp.swift** - App entry point defining scenes: main window, photo-detail pop-out, video-detail, shared-photo viewer (shared *videos* reuse video-detail), console, GPU memory monitor, remote-viewer, remote-video, remote-alert, and StereoscopicVideoSpace (immersive)
- **HypnosAppIntents.swift** - App-target glue for `RAVEOpenMainWindowIntent` (RAVEUI): the `AppIntentsPackage` chain plus the Siri/Shortcuts phrases ("Open a Hypnos window"). Exists because a visionOS icon tap with any window alive summons the nearest window to the user (dragging pinned windows out of their rooms) with no public opt-out — the intent is the supported way to always get a fresh main window at your location. The window-session registry itself is RAVEUI's `RAVEWindowSessionRegistry` (the local `WindowSessionRegistry` was deleted). The type window values persist their size as is likewise RAVEUI's now, `RAVECodableSize` — same property names as the deleted local `CodableSize`, so existing scene-restoration archives still decode.
- **AppModel.swift** - Central `@Observable` state container for gallery data, server config, filter state, video playback state, memory monitoring, and persisted settings (UserDefaults)
- **PhotoWindowModel.swift** - Per-window `@Observable` model for individual photo viewers. Contains all stored properties, init/start lifecycle, core image loading pipeline, interaction tracking, shared utilities, and resource cleanup. Split into extension files by concern:
  - **PhotoWindowModel+VisualAdjustments.swift** - Auto-enhance (3-tier cache), brightness/contrast/saturation adjustments, 3D adjustment preview with debounced reload
  - **PhotoWindowModel+Spatial3D.swift** - 3D mode activation/deactivation, `ImagePresentationComponent` creation, spatial 3D generation, viewing mode switching, resolution override
  - **PhotoWindowModel+BackgroundRemoval.swift** - Background removal pipeline: toggle, full-resolution processing, cache loading, resolution reloading, state management
  - **PhotoWindowModel+MemoryManagement.swift** - Idle downscale (release/thumbnail/restore), scene phase tracking, lightweight display transition
  - **PhotoWindowModel+GalleryNavigation.swift** - Gallery image switching, prev/next navigation, lazy loading pagination, rating/O-counter updates
  - **PhotoWindowModel+UIControls.swift** - Share sheet, UI auto-hide timers, image flip

### Windows Tab (window manager)
`WindowsTabView` is the app's window inventory: every open window with **Summon** and **Close** on each, plus Hide All / Close All underneath. The registry, the rows and the recycle mechanics are **RAVEUI's** `RAVEWindowRegistry` / `RAVEWindowManagerView`; the app supplies only labels and fresh-identity clones, in `Model/ManagedWindows.swift`, applied to each scene root in `HypnosApp` via `.manageWindow(...)`.

**Summon is a recycle, not a recall** — it dismisses the scene and opens an equivalent fresh one. That serves the ordinary case (fetch a window snapped in another room) *and* the visionOS 27 regression where a summoned scene is activated but never re-attached to a compositor placement, leaving the window permanently invisible while the scene still reports itself active and visible (`internal_docs/visionos27-invisible-window-feedback.md`; reproduces with stock Clock). Nothing app-side redraws such a scene, so destroying it is the only recovery — and `openWindow` against the live scene is the call that *causes* it, which is why the same dismiss-then-reopen shape already guards the cross-room summon in `ContentView.handleRemoteViewerOpenIfNeeded` / `handlePhotoWindowOpenIfNeeded`.

The `recreated()` clones on `PhotoWindowValue` / `VideoWindowValue` / `RemoteViewerWindowValue` / `RemoteAlertWindowValue` carry the same content under a **new window id**, which is what lets the dismiss and the open be issued in the same turn without the fresh window matching the dying scene. `SharedMediaItem` has no separable identity, so its window reopens verbatim after waiting for teardown. Recreated windows drop `wasPushed` — there is no originating gallery window left to pop back to.

Main windows are managed too, so a second Gallery window parked in another room is recoverable; each Windows tab excludes the window it is displayed in (RAVEUI's `raveWindowToken` environment value). Close All goes underneath SwiftUI to UIKit scene sessions (`RAVEWindowScenes.destroyAll(except:)`) because a window that never got a layout pass never registered — which is exactly the launch-time variant of the same bug.

### Data Flow
Three library sources, chosen via `AppModel.librarySource` (`LibrarySource`: `.photos`/`.stash`/`.local`) and resolved to the pair actually in force by `AppModel.effectiveLibrarySource`/`makeSources(for:apiClient:)`:
1. **PhotosImageSource/PhotosVideoSource** - The device photo library, via `PhotosIndexStore`. The default with no server configured, and always available — no setup needed.
2. **GraphQLImageSource/GraphQLVideoSource** - Fetches from a Stash server via `StashAPIClient`. Selectable once `stashServerURL` is set.
3. **LocalImageSource/LocalVideoSource** - Scans `Documents/Photos`/`Documents/Videos` for local files. Always available too, like Photos — needs no permission and no setup, so unlike Stash there's nothing to gate it behind. Settings → Local Files is informational only (where to put the files), not a toggle.

`AppModel.availableLibrarySources` is which of the three currently apply — Photos and Local unconditionally, Stash once a server is configured; `effectiveLibrarySource` falls back to Photos when the stored choice isn't one of them (server removed). The tab bar's library-switch button (`TabBarOrnament`, only shown on Pictures/Videos with more than one source available — which, with Local always in the list, means Pictures/Videos always) is a dropdown menu rather than a cycling button, since a third source made "tap to switch to the other one" ambiguous about where a tap would land.

Source protocols:
- `ImageSource` - Protocol for paginated image fetching with optional filter support
- `VideoSource` - Protocol for paginated video fetching

### Tab Navigation
Tabs defined in `Tab.swift`: Pictures, Videos, Albums, Filters, Windows, Settings, Remote (developer), Console (developer). Tab switching managed by `ContentView` with ornament-based navigation via `TabBarOrnament`. Remote and Console are conditionally visible based on `appModel.enableRemoteViewer`/`showDebugConsole`; Filters hides itself while browsing Local (nothing there to filter by — no tags, albums or galleries) and `ContentView` redirects away from it if it was already open when the library changed.

Past a separator at the **end of the tab bar**, `TabBarOrnament` shows a **play button** that starts a slideshow of what the current tab is showing (Pictures/Videos with the filter in force). It's absent on other tabs, and on Pictures/Videos until content has loaded. This is the supported way to get "slideshow of what I'm looking at"; see Gallery mode under Remote API Viewer. There used to be a Local tab with its own ornament-level slideshow case; Local is a library source now (see Data Flow above), and its folder browser (`LocalFolderBrowserView`, under Albums) offers its own per-folder "Play Slideshow" control in context instead.

### Albums Tab
`AlbumsTabView` browses whichever library is in force. For Photos and Stash, a container (`MediaContainer` — a Photos album/smart album, a Stash gallery, or for video a Stash group) is a single filter value: opening one calls `AppModel.applyContainer(_:isVideo:)`, which sets the matching field on `currentFilter`/`currentVideoFilter` and switches to Pictures/Videos, so there's no second content pipeline — paging, sort, and the rest of the filter are all the one the grids already use. `AppliedContainerBanner` is the way back, reading the applied filter rather than separate state so it can't disagree with the grid it's captioning.

Local doesn't fit that shape — a folder nests, and a `MediaContainer` is one filter value applied once, not a place to descend into and climb back out of — so `LocalFolderBrowserView` renders instead of the container grid whenever `appModel.effectiveLibrarySource == .local`: real up/down navigation over `Documents/Photos` or `Documents/Videos` (whichever `isVideo` — the same flag Photos/Stash use to split image vs. video containers — picks), with a folder tree state (`MainWindowModel.localFolderPath`, `.albumsReselected` for "pop to root" on a re-tap) that outlives tab switches for the same reason `albumsShowingVideos` does. Tapping a file opens it directly (no filter/apply step, since a folder's contents aren't a filter criterion); a per-folder "Play Slideshow" button covers what the ornament's slideshow button used to do for the old Local tab.

### Photo Viewer Architecture
All three photo viewer windows share the same rendering components:
- **PhotoDisplayView** - Shared image display with four rendering paths (in priority order): animated GIF (HEVC video player), RealityKit 3D (`ImagePresentationComponent`), GPU-backed 2D (`MetalImageView` with `MTLTexture`), and fallback UIImage. Manages window sizing, swipe navigation, and resize-triggered re-downsampling.
- **Window sizing goes through `WindowResizeCoalescer`** (`Services/`), and every new geometry request in the photo viewer must too. visionOS has no window-*position* API — `requestGeometryUpdate` carries only a size and the system decides where the resized window lands — so each granted resize is also an uncorrectable move. A pushed viewer shares the gallery's scene (`pushWindow` swaps content in place), so that move is the grid window walking around the room. Six triggers compute the same target size for one image open (branch `.onAppear`, `imageAspectRatio` change, load completion, end of swipe, `setUniformResizing`, the 0.5s verification pass); they are redundant as *requests*, not as triggers, so the coalescer sends the first and drops the restatements. Its evidence test is **not** "the window is the size I asked for": a requested size and the scene geometry that comes back differ by the chrome insets (the same mismatch `WindowSizeNudge` documents as a size ratchet), so it compares the scene geometry against itself — sampled before each request, and a restatement dropped only if the window has moved since. A window that has *not* moved means the request did nothing or was dropped, indistinguishable from here, so it goes through. Callers holding read-back evidence that a grant is wrong pass `force: true` and bypass the dedupe entirely: `verifyWindowSizeMatchesContent` (measured >5% mismatch) and the immersive verifier.
- **Immersive 3D always asks for the largest window the platform will give.** `requestVerifiedImmersiveResize` fits the image into a 3000x3000 box, which is always clamped (~2700x1360, height far tighter), so its request never equals its own grant — hence `force: true` and hence the verifier can't use "grant == request" as its settle test. It watches instead: a re-request needs *evidence* the grant is wrong — either the wrong shape (aspect mismatch: a competing request stomped ours) or the window still sitting at the scene-space size it had before the request across two samples (the request never landed). An aspect-correct grant still growing toward the ceiling is watched, not pushed; the old seeding made that case re-request on every single immersive entry. Entering and leaving immersive is inherently 2+ window moves, so on a pushed window it is the biggest single displacement source. Exiting invalidates the coalescer — its memory is of a request made against immersive bounds and says nothing about the windowed geometry being restored.
- **PhotoOrnamentView** - Unified ornament bar with `PhotoViewerContext` enum (`.pushedFromGallery`, `.standalone`, `.shared`) controlling which buttons appear. Layout: `[Gallery] | [< N/M >] | [Slideshow] | [3D v] | [Info] | [Share] | [Adjustments] | [extras] | [Resolution]`. The 3D button is a Menu (3D, Immersive 3D, 2D off). The Adjustments button opens `VisualAdjustmentsPopover`, the single home for all image enhancements: brightness/contrast/saturation/sharpen/opacity, auto-enhance, background removal, **and flip**. There is no "More" (triple-dot) menu — context-specific items (Pop Out when pushed, Save when shared) render inline as icon-only buttons via the `extraMenuItems` closure (at most one per context, so a drop-down would be single-item). The Info button opens `MediaDetailSheet` as a sheet.
- **PhotoWindowModel** - Per-window state, split across extension files by concern (see App Structure above). Created with `@State` in each wrapper view. Primary display property is `displayTexture: MTLTexture?` with `displayImage: UIImage?` as fallback. Cached texture variants: `backgroundRemovedTexture`, `originalDisplayTexture`, `autoEnhancedDisplayTexture`, `preAutoEnhanceDisplayTexture`.

The two thin wrapper views:
- **PhotoWindowView** - Handles both pushed and standalone modes via `wasPushed` parameter. Pushed mode: opened via `pushWindow` from gallery, dismisses back to gallery, has pop-out menu item. Standalone mode: opened via `openWindow` as independent pop-out window, has gallery button.
- **SharedPhotoWindowView** - Opens for images received via share sheet. Has save menu item and cache cleanup.

**Important pattern:** `PhotoWindowModel.init` must be side-effect-free because SwiftUI may re-create the view struct multiple times while `@State` discards duplicate models. All side effects (window count tracking, image loading tasks) are deferred to the `start()` method called from `onAppear`.

### Image Display Strategy
- **Default (Dynamic Image Resolution on):** Images open in GPU-backed 2D mode using an `MTLTexture` with `.private` storage (not counted as dirty CPU memory by jetsam). The source is downsampled via `CGImageSource`, uploaded to GPU via `CIContext.render`, and displayed through `MetalImageView` (MTKView wrapper). Re-downsampled on window resize (1-second debounce, 20% threshold). RealityKit is only loaded when the user activates 3D mode.
- **Dynamic Image Resolution off:** Images load at full native resolution. No re-downsampling on resize.
- **Deep color preservation:** Images with >8 bits per component (e.g. 16-bit JXL) use `rgba16Float` textures with `extendedLinearDisplayP3` color space. Standard 8-bit images use `bgra8Unorm` with `deviceRGB`.
- **Auto-3D restore prompt:** If an image was previously viewed in 3D (tracked via `ImageEnhancementTracker`), a capsule prompt pill appears at the bottom of the viewer offering "Restore" or dismiss. Image always opens in 2D — restoration is opt-in. Controlled by `showAutoRestorePrompt` + `autoRestoreImmersive` on `PhotoWindowModel`. Dismisses automatically after 10s (`autoRestorePromptDismissTask`) and when the user navigates to a different image via `switchToImage`. Use `presentAutoRestorePrompt(immersive:)` / `dismissAutoRestorePrompt()` helpers rather than toggling the flag directly so the timer stays in sync.
- **Important:** When swapping `displayTexture` (e.g. toggling background removal or auto-enhance from in-memory cache), `imageAspectRatio` must always be updated from the new texture's dimensions. The Metal renderer stretches the texture to fill its view — aspect ratio is controlled externally by SwiftUI's `.aspectRatio()` modifier driven by `imageAspectRatio`.

### Spatial 3D Images
Uses RealityKit's `ImagePresentationComponent` for 2D→3D conversion. States tracked via `Spatial3DImageState` enum: notGenerated → generating → generated. `ImagePresentationComponent` is a black-box component — it manages its own geometry and materials internally, so there's no direct access to its mesh or rendering pipeline.

**visionOS limitation:** `PostProcessEffect` / `PostProcessEffectContext` are unavailable on visionOS. Custom post-processing on `RealityView` content must use SwiftUI-level modifiers (`.mask()`, `.overlay()`) instead.

### Video Infrastructure

**The fake-3D pipeline now lives in `RAVEMedia`** (`~/Projects/RAVESDK`), linked as a local
Swift package: `Pseudo3DStereoEngine`, `StereoPump`, `PumpDepthSource` and its two
implementations, `CoreMLDepthProvider`, the whole `Depth*` family, `Pseudo3DSettings`, and
the stereo/depth Metal shaders. The descriptions below still hold — they describe the same
code — but the sources are in the package, and files that touch any of it need
`import RAVEMedia`. What stayed here: `Pseudo3DVideoPlayerView` itself (the SwiftUI
surface, window-chrome constants, gestures, and the `bindCommands` extension that wires the
engine's transport to `VideoWindowModel`/`VideoLoopController`).

Three seams that migration created, and that will bite if missed:
- `AppModel.init` sets `RAVEMediaPolicy.depthCacheCap`. Remove it and the depth cache
  never evicts — the package has no notion of `CacheBudget`.
- `Shaders.metal` here holds only the image shaders. The pseudo-3D warp and every depth
  kernel are in the package's own `default.metallib`; `MetalImageRenderer` no longer has
  any `pseudo3D*` member.
- The two depth log categories were renamed with the move (`VideoCache`/`VideoWindow` →
  `DepthCache`/`Pseudo3D`). Same subsystem, so the in-app console still shows them.
- **VideoWindowModel** - Per-window `@MainActor @Observable` model (mirrors `PhotoWindowModel`) owning the window's current video, navigation snapshot (own copy of `galleryVideos` + `currentIndex` + lazy pagination), 3D intent (`stereoscopicOverride`/`video3DSettings`), flip, per-window `currentAdjustments`, playback state (`currentTime`/`duration`/`isPaused`/`isMuted`/`bufferedEnd`/`isScrubbing`), the `VideoLoopController`, share state, and auto-hide timers. Side-effect-free `init`; side effects in `start()`; `cleanup()` on dismiss. This replaced the old shared `AppModel.selectedVideo`/`videoStereoscopicOverride`/`video3DSettings`/`isVideoFlipped`/`videoVisualAdjustments` + app-level auto-hide, so multiple video windows are fully independent (fixes the bug where every pushed window showed the last-selected video). Created with `@State` in `VideoWindowView(windowValue:appModel:)`.
- **VideoWindowView** - Thin wrapper handling both pushed and standalone modes via `wasPushed` (same pattern as `PhotoWindowView`). Picks the render path per `windowModel`: immersive `StereoscopicVideoView` (`shouldUse3DMode`), real-time `Pseudo3DVideoPlayerView` (`shouldUsePseudo3D`), else the flat player (`playbackRenderer`: `.resolving` → `.nativeMetal` `NativeMetalVideoPlayerView` → `.webKit` `WebVideoPlayerView`). Also hosts the `VideoControlBar` overlay (2D players only) and the ornament. Locks window aspect ratio using **this** window's scene via `@Environment(SceneDelegate.self)` (not an arbitrary foreground scene); after each lock request a one-shot follow-up (`aspectRelockTask`) reads back the *granted* scene size and re-locks to a video-true size fitting inside it — portrait videos hit the platform's max window height, and a clamped grant under `.uniform` otherwise locks a wrong ratio (permanent letterbox between video and chrome, no room to enlarge). **Fake-3D chrome depth:** the ornament is kept coplanar with the visionOS window controls (`pseudo3DChromeZOffset = 0`; an earlier 20cm push floated the chrome off that plane and occluded the window controls) and the video is pulled back to that same plane by `Pseudo3DVideoPlayerView.videoPlaneZRecess` (90pt ≈ 9cm; the front-aligned `.frame(depth: 0, alignment: .front)` slab sits at the front of the window's depth region, measured ~9cm proud of the chrome on-device — the recess is applied as `.offset(z:)` on the GeometryReader3D so the fit math is unaffected; both constants stay tunable). `pseudo3DChromeBottomLift`/`ornamentBottomPadding` give the taller two-row fake-3D ornament clearance from the controls below.
- **VideoControlBar** - Custom SwiftUI transport controls for the 2D web player, replacing Safari's native `<video>` controls. Layout: `[play/pause] [elapsed] [scrubber] [duration] [A-B] [clear?] [mute]`. The scrubber shows the buffered range and A/B loop markers and supports tap-to-seek / drag-to-scrub. Shown only for the 2D player and gated by `!windowModel.isUIHidden` (hides in sync with the ornament; window controls follow ~1.5s later via `persistentSystemOverlays`). Drives the `<video>` entirely through `VideoWindowModel`'s command closures.
- **VideoOrnamentsView** - Unified ornament bar, styled to match `PhotoOrnamentView`. Layout: `[Gallery] | [< N/M >] | [ViewMode v] | [Info] | [Share] | [... More v] | [Title]`. The ViewMode menu switches **2D**, immersive **3D** (+ "Edit 3D Settings" when active), and **"Convert to 3D (Beta)"** — the fake-3D path (gated `disabled` to `windowModel.pseudo3DAvailable` — AVFoundation-decodable now, or reachable via the Stash transcode; realtime or pre-processed, see the engage flow below). The three modes are a **radio group** (`modeButton` + `currentViewMode`): exactly one carries the checkmark, selecting another switches directly, re-selecting the active one is a no-op (leaving a mode = picking another). There is no "3D Depth" preset submenu (strength is pinned — see `Pseudo3DSettings`; convergence lives in the Adjustments window); whenever fake-3D is available (`pseudo3DAvailable`) the menu also shows **both** depth-model submenus — **Depth Model (Real-Time)** and **Depth Model (Pre-Process)** — and this video's conversion progress + Cancel while a background conversion runs; the mode label reads `3D*` in fake-3D. Playback transport (incl. A-B loop) normally lives in the separate `VideoControlBar` overlay, but with `showTransport: true` (set by `VideoWindowView` for fake-3D) the control bar is stacked as a **second ornament row** so all chrome shares the video's plane. The More menu's **Adjustments** button opens the standalone `video-adjustments` window (`VideoAdjustmentsWindowView`) rather than a popover — it sets `appModel.videoAdjustmentsTarget`, so the panel is freely repositionable and never occluded by the front-plane fake-3D video; also Slideshow and Pop Out (when pushed). Info button opens `MediaDetailSheet`. Takes `@Bindable var windowModel`.
- **VideoLoopController** - `@Observable @MainActor` per-window model (owned by `VideoWindowModel`) for the A-B loop on the 2D web player. Cycles `idle → aSet → active → idle`: 1st press sets A, **2nd press sets B and engages immediately** (no confirmation step), 3rd press (or the control-bar clear button → `clear()`) disables. Owns its own toast state. Wires `queryCurrentTime`/`setLoopBounds` closures bound by `WebVideoPlayerView` to the JS rVFC monitor (`window.__startABLoop` / `window.__stopABLoop`).
- **Stream-URL strategy (Stash scenes)** - `GalleryVideo.streamURL` is **always the server's original file**; `transcodeStreamURL` holds Stash's live transcode (HLS `/stream.m3u8` preferred, else the non-seekable fragmented `/stream.mp4`) as a *reserve*, populated for every scene advertising endpoints when Settings → Server-Side Transcoding is on (`enableStashTranscoding`, default on). WebKit decodes WebM (VP8/VP9) on-device, so nothing transcodes up front. The transcode is engaged in exactly three cases: (1) the WebKit player reports the original unplayable — a decode/unsupported-source error immediately, a network error after its retries — via `onSourceUnplayable` → `VideoWindowModel.handleSourceUnplayable()`; (2) any fake-3D engage on a WebKit-decoded source, funnelled through `enablePseudo3D()`; (3) `transcodedDownloadURL` (MV-HEVC + depth pre-process), which prefers the transcode rewritten to `/stream.mp4` because AVAssetReader can't read WebM at all. `VideoWindowModel.activeStreamURL`/`usingTranscodedStream` track which one is playing (reset per video switch); `canUseTranscodedStream` and `pseudo3DAvailable` gate the UI. **AVFoundation still cannot decode WebM on visionOS 27** (VP8 and VP9 both fail `AVURLAsset.isPlayable`), which is why the transcode detour exists at all — the renderer probe (`canPlayNatively`) is a live check, so if that ever changes the native path unlocks itself with no code change.
- **WebVideoPlayerView** - `WKWebView`-based player (kept for WebM support). Native `controls` are off for the main video window; a custom-controls bridge is enabled by passing an optional `playbackModel: VideoWindowModel`. State flows JS→Swift over the `videoPlayback` message channel (`timeupdate`/`play`/`pause`/`seeked`/`volumechange`/`loadedmetadata` post `{currentTime,duration,paused,muted,buffered}`); commands flow Swift→JS via `play`/`pause`/`seek`/`setMuted` closures bound in `updateUIView`. The bridge is additive/optional — other callers (animated GIFs in `PhotoDisplayView`, remote-viewer videos, stereoscopic 2D fallback) pass no `playbackModel` and are unaffected. Error escalation has two independent forms: `fallbackVideoURL` swaps `src` **inside the page** (remote slideshow's raw → HLS tiers), while `onSourceUnplayable` reports up to Swift (main video window) so the re-route also re-resolves the renderer. **Autoplay is driven from inside the page** (`kickAutoplay`, retried on `loadeddata`/`canplay`, cancelled by an explicit pause): the bare `autoplay` attribute is dropped when the page loads into a WKWebView not yet in the window hierarchy, which is what left prev/next-switched videos sitting on a blank frame. `window._roomActive` is likewise baked into the HTML at load (and `lastIsRoomActive` seeded) so the room-activity JS never fires against a page that hasn't loaded.
- **NativeMetalVideoPlayerView** - Flat-video path used when the source is AVFoundation-decodable (`playbackRenderer == .nativeMetal`): `AVPlayer` + `AVPlayerItemVideoOutput` → per-frame `MTLTexture` → `MetalImageView`. Preferred over WebKit for local/HLS sources; audio uses `.mixWithOthers` (see `AudioSessionConfig`) so it doesn't interrupt other apps. Falls back to `WebVideoPlayerView` on decode failure (`forceWebKitPlayback`). Being `.nativeMetal` — or being *reachable* via the server transcode, i.e. `pseudo3DAvailable` — is the gate for the fake-3D "Convert to 3D" option.
- **Pseudo3DVideoPlayerView** / **Pseudo3DStereoEngine** - Real-time "fake 3D": converts a **mono** video to windowed stereoscopic 3D in an ordinary Shared-Space window — no immersive space, no MV-HEVC pre-compute. `AVPlayer` owns audio/clock/transport/scrubbing/A-B loop; decoded mono frames are warped per-eye and enqueued into an `AVSampleBufferVideoRenderer` feeding a `VideoPlayerComponent(.stereo)` inside a `RealityView`. The video plane is aligned `.front` then recessed by `videoPlaneZRecess` (~90pt) back to the chrome/window-controls plane (a centered slab was the old "Flip3D recession"; the bare front alignment sat ~9cm proud). The window is sized to the video by the aspect lock in `VideoWindowView`; the plane itself is fitted from the **video aspect, never the measured mesh** — `VideoPlayerComponent`'s screen mesh for renderer-backed components reads 1×1 (placeholder square) until the first tagged frames present, then silently settles at (videoAspect × 1)m with no `VideoSizeDidChange` event, so any scale derived from measured bounds is computed against the stale square; `fitVideo` derives the screen dims from the pump-reported video size instead (measured bounds only as a pre-size fallback), and `scheduleRefitBurst` re-installs the tap target once the mesh adopts the real aspect. A menu/popover open (`chromeOpen`) fades the video via `OpacityComponent` so presented chrome shows through it (depth can't dodge the zero-depth slab). Carries its own `SpatialTapGesture` tap target (a 2D overlay can't catch gaze over a `RealityView`) to toggle chrome. Falls back to the flat native player via `onPlaybackError`. Also used by the **slideshow** (see Slideshow 3D below) and `VideoQuickLookView`; `loops` / `contentOpacity` / `onDurationKnown` exist for those callers.
- **StereoPump** - `@unchecked Sendable`; owns **all** per-frame GPU work on a dedicated background queue with its own `MTLCommandQueue` — **never** the main thread (an earlier main-actor pump SIGKILLed backboardd via the compositor watchdog). Each tick: pull the newest decoded frame, get depth for **that exact frame** from its `PumpDepthSource`, warp into two BGRA eye targets (occlusion-correct depth-displaced mesh, 193×109 grid — `MetalImageRenderer.pseudo3DGridColumns/Rows`), convert each to full-range 420f via `VTPixelTransferSession` (carrying the source's color tags), tag `.leftEye`/`.rightEye`, and enqueue a `CMReadySampleBuffer`. Tick rate is **60 fps in both modes**; in realtime mode `RealtimeDepthSource` infers at ~30Hz (`reinferInterval` 1/35s on the video timeline) and **holds** the map for the in-between frame — a *bounded* ≤1-frame depth age (never the unbounded staleness of an async-decoupled pump, which the user rejected); ≤30fps content's frame spacing exceeds the interval so it stays fully lock-step, seeks always re-infer, and a slow inference gates its own tick so the cadence self-throttles back to ~30fps video. Bounded eye-buffer pool; each eye gets its **own** depth attachment (sharing one cross-contaminated the right eye = over-warp). In cached mode a missing depth frame (post-seek rebuild gap) renders **flat** with a ~150ms strength ramp back — never the heuristic warp, never wrong-frame depth. Per-stage `os_signpost` intervals (`AppLogger.pseudo3DSignposter`) cover inference/stabilize/warp/transfer.
- **PumpDepthSource** (protocol, called only on the pump queue) - `RealtimeDepthSource` wraps `CoreMLDepthProvider` (synchronous same-frame inference, identity value mapping); `CachedDepthSource` wraps `DepthCacheReader` (below). `PumpFrameDepth` carries the texture + letterbox UV transform + per-frame value scale/bias + median (auto-convergence).
- **CoreMLDepthProvider** (conforms to **DepthProvider**) - Core ML monocular depth (Depth Anything V2) driving the mesh warp; `depth(for:) -> MTLTexture?` is synchronous; `inferRawDepth(from:)` returns the raw, unnormalized map for the offline converter. Vision uses **`.scaleFit`** (aspect-preserving letterbox); the warp remaps UVs into the content region via `letterboxUVTransform` (shared with the converter; anchor is a named constant — flip if on-device parallax reads vertically offset). Model is loaded by name from the managed store (`DepthModelStore`), honoring the role-specific preference: `CoreMLDepthProvider(device:role:)` with `DepthModelRole` `.realtime` (RealtimeDepthSource, engage checks) or `.preprocess` (DepthConverter, cache-store lookups); `hasAvailableModel(role:)`/`resolvedModelName(role:)` take the role too. **Fake-3D requires real depth — no heuristic fallback**: `Pseudo3DStereoEngine.load` requires a cache entry (cached mode) or `hasAvailableModel()` (realtime), else falls back to the flat 2D player via `onPlaybackError`. Stabilization is a separable gaussian (`depthBlurH`/`depthBlurVEMA`, one command buffer) + motion-adaptive temporal EMA on ping-pong `r16Float`; the raw Vision output is read via a zero-copy texture-cache view held across the stabilize wait (blit copy only when stabilization can't run).
- **DepthConverter / DepthCacheStore / DepthConversionManager / DepthCacheReader** - The **pre-processed** fake-3D path ("Convert to 3D" → Pre-Process). `DepthConverter` (two-stage `.utility` pipeline: stage A decodes + runs ANE inference while stage B — the `PostStage` class, serial post queue with a 2-frame backpressure semaphore — does all GPU work + encoding on earlier frames, so total time ≈ pure inference time) decodes every frame (downscaled at decode to ~2× model input), infers depth, computes per-frame robust stats on GPU (min/max reduction + 256-bin histogram → p2/p98/median), refines with a **joint-bilateral** filter guided by the frame's luma (edge-aware — depth snaps to image edges), applies a **lookahead** ±2-frame temporal window (truncated at scene cuts, detected by histogram shape + range jumps), and encodes depth into an HEVC grayscale `depth.mov` (luma plane, source PTS verbatim, VFR-safe). A post-pass smooths the display range within cut-delimited segments (snaps across cuts — no pumping, no lag) and writes per-frame `displayScale/Bias/Median` arrays to `meta.json`. **Motion-adaptive inference skipping** (`FrameChangeDetector`, stage A): a sparse 48×48 luma signature per decoded frame is compared against the last *inferred* frame (drift accumulates, so slow motion still re-infers; 60-skip staleness cap); a static frame hands stage B `inferred: nil`, which already means "repeat the previous depth" — exact when nothing moved, zero ANE work. Conservative threshold (mean |Δluma| < 1.0/255-scale) so grainy footage simply never skips. **High-frame-rate sources (≥48fps, `twoPassMinFrameRate`) convert in two passes**: pass 1 infers every other frame into a complete half-rate `depth.mov` (watchable in half the time — the reader serves the nearest earlier depth frame in the gaps, ≤1 frame of depth lag), then pass 2 infers only the skipped frames into `depth-b.mov` (a finished AVAssetWriter file can't accept interleaved PTS) and finalizes metadata **merged across both lattices** (display-range smoothing over one timeline — per-lattice ranges would shimmer at 60Hz; adjacent duplicate cut flags collapse to the exact cut frame). Total inference cost is unchanged; the entry stays `completed: false` until pass 2 finishes, so an interrupted pass 2 never leaves a half-rate cache posing as done (cancel/failure deletes the directory as always), and the manager reports pass 2 as the `.refining` phase with frontier pinned to the duration — the progressive-engage condition passes immediately. `DepthCacheStore` keys entries by (video identity = stashId, model name, `pipelineVersion` — bump to invalidate old caches) under backup-excluded `Application Support/DepthCache/`; `entry(videoIdentity:)` (playback) prefers the selected pre-process model but accepts any completed entry (baked depth outlives model deletion); `engageEntry(videoIdentity:)` (engage flow) accepts only the selected pre-process model's entry while any model is installed — switching the model re-offers conversion instead of silently reusing another model's depth — falling back to any entry only when no model remains. The depth cache participates in `CacheBudget`: `enforceBudget(activeIdentity:)` LRU-evicts least-recently-watched completed entries (`DepthCacheReader` touches its entry's directory on open), called after each conversion and from the Settings cache section; in-progress and just-completed entries are never evicted. `DepthConversionManager` (`@MainActor @Observable` singleton) runs one job at a time (ANE contention), downloads remote sources first (AVAssetReader needs local files), exposes per-phase progress/cancel and `lastCompleted`/`lastError` events. `DepthCacheReader` decodes the entry's depth file(s) sequentially with a small lookahead, PTS-matched to the pulled frame — two-pass entries get one decode stream per file, merged by PTS, and a growing entry probes for `depth-b.mov` appearing so playback upgrades to full-rate depth mid-conversion; seeks outside the window rebuild the reader at the target (~50-100ms flat gap).
- **DepthModelStore** - Filesystem management for depth models. Managed store is `Application Support/DepthModels/` (excluded from backup — models are large, re-downloadable). Documents is a drop-off **inbox**: `importInboxModels()` (run at launch from `AppModel.init` and on Settings appear) moves any `.mlmodelc`/`.mlpackage` there into the store and deletes it from Documents, so the manual `scripts/push-depth-model.sh` path and the in-app download converge on the same switchable/deletable store. Custom models are generated with `scripts/convert-depth-model.py` (DA V2 Small/Base/Large at any multiple-of-14 resolution; a validated precision ladder keeps overflow-prone ops in fp32 — all-FP16 Base/Large shows a wave/grid artifact from DINOv2 float16 overflow). Also owns the shared compiled-`.mlmodelc` cache dir (`CompiledDepthModels/`), cleared per-model on delete.
- **DepthModelManager** - `@MainActor @Observable` singleton for in-app model download/management. Offers 4 Depth Anything V2 **Small** variants (F16 / INT8 / 6-bit / 8-bit palettized — no F32) downloaded straight from Apple's canonical HF repo (`apple/coreml-depth-anything-v2-small`); nothing is re-hosted. Each model is a `.mlpackage` of 3 fixed files fetched via `resolve/main/…` URLs (via a delegate-driven `FileDownloader` for byte progress), rebuilt in the store, then Core-ML-compiled on first use. Per-file size + SHA-256 come from HF's tree API for integrity verification. Add/download/delete happens ONLY in the **Depth Model Manager modal** (`DepthModelManagerSheet`, Settings → Developer): per-row delete (incl. custom models; clears any preference pointing at the deleted model), download progress, and role badges. Which installed model each pipeline *uses* is chosen by two Display-settings dropdowns — **Real-Time 3D Depth Model** (`AppModel.realtimeDepthModelName`) and **Pre-Process 3D Depth Model** (`AppModel.preprocessDepthModelName`, so a slower/larger model can serve conversions only). "" = automatic (first installed); the legacy `preferredDepthModelName` key is migrated into both on launch and still read as a fallback. The video ViewMode menu carries a submenu per role: **Depth Model (Real-Time)** applies to the video being watched immediately — `Pseudo3DVideoPlayerView` observes `appModel.realtimeDepthModelName` and calls `engine.reloadDepthPipeline()` (rebuilds the pump, preserving position/pause) — while **Depth Model (Pre-Process)** picks the model future conversions and the engage flow's cache lookup use. A third Display setting, **Real-Time 3D for All Videos** (`AppModel.defaultRealtimePseudo3D`, default off), auto-engages fake-3D on every eligible video once its renderer resolves to `.nativeMetal` (`VideoWindowModel.autoEngagePseudo3DIfPreferred`): prefers the strict `engageEntry` cache, else realtime when a model is installed, else silently stays 2D (never forces the setup sheet, never overrides restored fake-3D or genuine stereoscopic).
- **Convert to 3D engage flow** (`VideoWindowModel.requestPseudo3D()`, all paths funnelled through `enablePseudo3D()` — which first swaps a WebKit-decoded source onto the server transcode and replays the parked intent via `pendingPseudo3DEngage` once the renderer resolves): a completed depth cache **from the selected pre-process model** (`DepthCacheStore.engageEntry`) → engage **pre-processed** playback directly (`pseudo3DDepthMode = .cached`); no model AND no cache → `DepthModelSetupSheet` (re-enters the flow after install); otherwise an **alert** asks **Real-Time** (engages the 30fps synchronous path; never starts a conversion — it would fight live inference for the ANE) vs **Pre-Process** (background conversion while the window plays 2D). The ViewMode menu shows the conversion's phase/progress with a Cancel item, and the same status appears at the **rightmost of the ornament** so it's visible without opening the menu. **Progressive playback:** the depth video is a *fragmented* QuickTime with provisional meta.json writes, so a Pre-Process window auto-engages cached 3D **mid-conversion** once safe — `startProgressiveEngageMonitor` polls `DepthConversionManager.progressiveStatus` (frontier + rate EMA) and engages when `remainingConversion ≤ rate × remainingPlayback × 0.8` and the frontier leads the playhead by ≥10s (constants on `VideoWindowModel`); `DepthCacheReader` follows the growing file (fresh `AVURLAsset` per rebuild — a cached asset never sees new fragments); while a conversion runs, `Pseudo3DStereoEngine.load` prefers the growing entry over an older completed one from a different model, and an underrun (thermal throttle) degrades to flat depth + ramp, never a stall. The progressive engage is **paused** (`engageCachedPseudo3D(startPaused: true)` → `pseudo3DEngagePaused` → `engine.load(startPaused:)`): the stereo player seeks and warps a **single frame** (visibly playable in 3D) but doesn't start sustained playback — a second decode session concurrent with the converter's `AVAssetReader` can trip a transient VideoToolbox decode failure ("Invalid sample cursor"; `DepthConversionManager` also auto-retries those). The user's manual **Play** opts into the second session; `startPaused` also clears `wasPlayingBeforeRoomExit` so a room activation doesn't auto-play the still. Engaging fake-3D resumes at the 2D player's position (`pseudo3DEngageResumeTime` → `engine.load(startAt:)`). Completion while the window moved on shows the **"3D version ready — Watch in 3D" capsule pill** (photo auto-restore pattern, `presentDepthReadyPrompt`/`dismissDepthReadyPrompt`, 10s auto-dismiss); cancel mid-progressive-playback drops back to 2D; failure alerts once. Restored windows with fake-3D engaged prefer the cache when one exists (`start()`); `switchToVideo` resets mode to `.realtime`. Settings (Developer) lists converted videos ("Converted 3D Videos": size/model/outdated marker, per-entry delete, Clear All — `DepthCacheSettingsView`).
- **Pseudo3DSettings** - Per-window fake-3D tuning: `depthStrength` (max per-eye horizontal disparity in UV, default = Subtle `0.008`) and `convergence` (which depth sits on the window plane, default `1.0`). **Convergence polarity is easy to get backwards:** the shader is `disparity = (depth − convergence) × depthStrength` over an *inverse*-depth map, so 1 is the NEAR end and **raising convergence pushes the scene back** — at `1.0` every frame's nearest content lands on the glass and nothing crosses in front of the window frame (no window violation). Disparity is baked (not IPD-scaled) and its *angular* size grows with window size, so it starts conservative. `isModified` drives per-window vs. `AppModel.globalPseudo3DSettings` fallback (`effectivePseudo3DSettings`) and Reset, mirroring `VisualAdjustments`. **Corollary for persistence:** `VideoWindowView`'s pop-out snapshot writes `pseudo3DSettings` into the `VideoWindowValue` **only when `isModified`** (nil otherwise, so the window keeps following the global). Snapshotting an unmodified value would bake in whatever `.default` happened to be, and a later default change would make that stale value start counting as modified and shadow the global. Anything else persisting a `Pseudo3DSettings` needs the same guard. **Codable back-compat:** `init(from:)` is hand-written with `decodeIfPresent` so persisted JSON survives new fields — keep it updated when adding fields; retired keys need no handling (keyed decoding ignores unmatched JSON keys). It also **normalizes the legacy `0.45` convergence default to the current one** (`legacyConvergenceDefault`) — required, not cosmetic: a persisted global would otherwise keep the old plane forever, and since `isModified` compares against `.default`, a per-window `0.45` would start counting as modified and shadow the global. Any future default change needs the same treatment (the slider is continuous and unstepped, so an exact old-default value is only ever reachable *as* the old default). Live-editable via the Adjustments window's **Convergence** control (strength is pinned, see above). **Removed: auto-convergence** (tracked the conversion's lookahead-smoothed median as the zero-parallax plane, cached-mode-only). The realtime depth map is min/max normalized *per frame* (`CoreMLDepthProvider.makeTexture`), so a fixed convergence is already scene-adaptive — the frame's nearest content is always exactly 1.0 — and unlike a tracked median it cannot wander, which is why the converter needed ±2-frame lookahead plus cut detection to make its median usable at all. `DepthCacheStore.Entry.Meta.displayMedian` is still written (free by-product of the p2/p98 histogram; removing it would force a `pipelineVersion` bump and invalidate every existing cache) but no longer consumed.
- **StereoscopicVideoPlayer** - Coordinates download → MV-HEVC conversion → immersive playback. The immersive space is global (one at a time): `StereoscopicVideoView` registers `AppModel.immersiveVideoOwner` (the owning `VideoWindowModel`) on enter, and `ImmersiveVideoView` reads that window's `stereoscopicOverride`.
- **MVHEVCConverter** - Converts side-by-side/over-under stereoscopic video to MV-HEVC format
- **ImmersiveVideoView** - RealityKit-based immersive player in full immersion space
- **Video3DSettingsSheet** - Manual override for stereoscopic format detection

### Memory Management
- **Disk caches (`LRUDiskCache` + `CacheBudget`):** every on-disk cache (images, videos, thumbnails, auto-enhance, bg-removal, GIF-HEVC, thumbnail dioramas) shares one engine: incremental size tracking (no per-write directory enumeration; counter resynced on each eviction pass), LRU eviction to 80% of cap, mtime touch on read. Caps derive from device storage: the Settings cache preset (Standard/Large/Maximum = 10/18/30% of capacity, `CacheSizePreset`) × per-domain share (`CacheBudget.Domain`), bounded by a 15 GB free-space floor that pushes caps below current usage when the disk fills (caches actively give space back). Engine hooks: `companionURLs` (video metadata sidecars evicted together), `evictsFirst` (auto-enhance/bg-removal entries are xattr-tagged with their source's image-cache key and evict first once the original is gone; tag only set when the original is actually in DiskImageCache — local files are never tagged), `pendingBytes` (`DiskVideoCache.reserveCapacity(token:expectedBytes:)` counts an in-flight MV-HEVC conversion against the cap). Settings → Cache is the manager UI (`CacheSettingsSection`): preset picker, per-cache usage vs nominal cap, inline Clear, free space.
- **GPU-private textures:** 2D display uses `MTLTexture` with `.private` storage mode. These live in GPU memory (not dirty CPU pages), avoiding jetsam pressure. Apple Silicon applies automatic lossless compression to private textures (~30-50% savings).
- **`SendableTexture` wrapper:** `@unchecked Sendable` struct wrapping `MTLTexture` for crossing actor/Task boundaries, since `MTLTexture` protocol doesn't declare `Sendable`.
- **`DispatchSource` memory pressure:** `AppModel` monitors system memory pressure via `DispatchSource.makeMemoryPressureSource`. On critical pressure, triggers LRU idle-downscale of photo windows. On warning, trims caches.
- **`.mappedIfSafe` data loading:** Disk cache reads use `Data(contentsOf:options:.mappedIfSafe)` for memory-mapped I/O where possible.
- **`autoreleasepool`:** Used around image decode/upload paths to promptly release transient Objective-C objects.
- `useLightweightDisplay` flag triggers all photo windows to switch from RealityKit to SwiftUI Image on memory warning
- `openPhotoWindowCount` tracks active photo windows; `memoryBudgetExceeded` gates new window creation
- `ImageLoader` uses NSCache with 512MB memory limit
- `PhotoWindowModel.cleanup()` explicitly releases GPU textures and image data on window dismiss

### Services
- **MetalImageRenderer** - Sendable singleton managing Metal device, command queue, CIContext, and two render pipeline states (8-bit bgra8Unorm and 16-bit rgba16Float). Creates GPU-private textures from CGImage, UIImage, or URL (with CGImageSource downsampling). Uses `CIContext.render` for correct handling of all source pixel formats and color spaces. Flips CIImage vertically before render (CIImage origin is bottom-left, Metal expects top-left).
- **Shaders.metal** - Vertex shader (procedural fullscreen quad, 6 vertices, no vertex buffer) + fragment shader (brightness/contrast/saturation adjustments matching SwiftUI modifiers).
- **MetalImageView** - `UIViewRepresentable` wrapping `MTKView`. Draw-on-demand mode (`isPaused=true`, `enableSetNeedsDisplay=true`). Transparent background. Auto-detects deep color textures and switches framebuffer format and pipeline state.
- **NativeVideoDecodeProbe** - Shared "can AVFoundation decode this URL?" check (`AVURLAsset.isPlayable` + a non-empty video track, trusting `isPlayable` alone for `.m3u8` since HLS exposes video via `AVAssetVariant`), plus a timeout-bounded overload. Being decodable is what unlocks the native Metal player and real-time fake-3D. Used by `VideoWindowModel.resolvePlaybackRenderer` and `SlideshowEngine.resolvePseudo3DTarget`.

### Incoming URLs & web-yt-dlp (YouTube-in-3D)
The app registers a `hypnos://play?url=<link>` custom URL scheme (declared in `Info.plist`, handled by **IncomingURLHandler**; a `SceneDelegate` notification path covers file-share cold launches that SwiftUI's `.onOpenURL` misses, so `AppModel.shouldProcessIncomingURL` de-dupes the double-fire). This is the primary way to send arbitrary web videos into the app — most conveniently via the **"Open in Spatial Viewer"** iOS/visionOS Shortcut (<https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c313953ed4c245f988ca746808109b8d>), which shares any link into the scheme; a bookmarklet works too.

- **StreamableURLResolver** classifies the incoming URL: `.directVideo` (MP4/HLS — plays immediately, no proxy), `.webPage` (routed through web-yt-dlp when enabled), or `.notPlayable`. Direct links open a stream video window straight away.
- **WebYTDLPClient** (`struct`, built from `AppModel.webYTDLPClient`) builds `{endpoint}/stream?url=<page>&token=<token>&preset=<preset>&height=<height>` for a self-hosted [web-yt-dlp](https://github.com/illixion/web-yt-dlp) instance. The app does **not** pre-resolve metadata — it hands the stream URL straight to AVPlayer and the server runs yt-dlp + muxes + streams on the fly (HTTP Range supported). Token rides as a query param because AVPlayer can't easily attach a Bearer header. Playing web videos this way feeds the native-Metal player, so they can be converted to fake-3D — the point of the feature is watching e.g. 4K YouTube in windowed stereoscopic 3D.
- **Settings (Developer → Web yt-dlp Support):** `webYTDLPEnabled` gates web-page routing; `webYTDLPEndpoint`/`webYTDLPToken` configure the proxy; and two dropdowns pick the re-encode target — `webYTDLPPreset` (`AppModel.webYTDLPPresetOptions`: HEVC/`h265` default — tagged `hvc1` for AVPlayer's native path, source stream-copied when already HEVC — or `h264`) and `webYTDLPHeight` (`AppModel.webYTDLPHeightOptions`: 1080 or 2160/4K default). Defaults live on `WebYTDLPClient.defaultPreset`/`defaultHeight`; `streamURL(forPage:preset:height:)` takes both as overridable params. All persisted to UserDefaults and included in `SettingsBackup`. The section links both the web-yt-dlp repo and the Shortcut.

### API Client
`StashAPIClient` is an actor that handles GraphQL communication with Stash server. Accessible via `appModel.apiClient` (private(set)). Supports:
- **List queries:** `findImages`, `findScenes`, `findGalleries`, `findTags`, `findStudios`, `findPerformers` (paginated, with filters)
- **Detail queries:** `fetchImageDetail(id:)` → `ImageDetail`, `fetchSceneDetail(id:)` → `SceneDetail` (on-demand full metadata)
- **Mutations:** `updateImage`/`updateScene` (full field update), `updateImageRating`/`updateSceneRating`, `incrementImageOCounter`/`decrementImageOCounter`, `incrementSceneOCounter`/`decrementSceneOCounter`
- **Delete:** `destroyImage`/`destroyScene` (single), `destroyImages`/`destroyScenes` (bulk), with `deleteFile` and `deleteGenerated` options
- Server config persisted via UserDefaults

### Media Metadata & Detail Views
- **MediaMetadata.swift** - Lightweight shared structs: `MediaTag`, `MediaPerformer`, `MediaStudio`, `MediaGalleryRef`, `MediaGroupRef`, plus full detail structs `ImageDetail` and `SceneDetail` (fetched on-demand, not in list queries)
- **MediaDetailSheet** - Two-tab sheet (Info read-only + Edit) opened from the ornament Info button. Info tab shows file metadata, associations (tags/performers/studio/galleries as chips via `FlowLayout`), and stats. Edit tab has searchable pickers for tags/performers/studio, text fields, rating editor, URL list, and organized toggle. **Edits are committed automatically when the sheet closes** (both the "Done" button and swipe/other dismissal via `onDisappear`) — there is no explicit Save button; `commitChanges(using:)` writes only when `hasUnsavedChanges` (diffed against an `EditSnapshot` baseline). O-counter +/- is committed immediately (separate from the save-on-close path). On a successful save the `onSaved(rating100)` callback lets the presenting ornament update `windowModel.image`/`video.rating100` so the Info icon refreshes live. Delete section at bottom with confirmation dialog ("Remove from Stash" vs "Delete File from Disk")

### Multi-Select
Gallery grids (`GalleryGridView`, `VideoGalleryView`) support multi-select mode:
- Toolbar "Select" button toggles `appModel.isSelectingImages`/`isSelectingVideos`
- Thumbnails show checkbox overlay; tapping toggles selection in `selectedImageIds`/`selectedVideoIds` (Set<String> of stash IDs)
- Bottom selection toolbar: Select All / Deselect All, count label, Delete button with bulk confirmation dialog
- Bulk delete via `destroyImages`/`destroyScenes` API calls

### Remote API Viewer
A slideshow viewer that fetches images from a [RoboFrame](https://github.com/illixion/RoboFrame) API and displays them with clock/sensor overlays, Ken Burns animation, WebSocket control, and Home Assistant integration. Enabled via Settings → Developer → Enable Remote API Viewer, which adds a "Remote" tab.

**Protocol reference:** The authoritative WebSocket protocol spec lives in the RoboFrame repo at `~/Projects/RoboFrame/docs/protocol.md` (frames, readiness barrier, playback cycle, action scoping). Consult it before changing any WS message handling.

**Architecture:**
- **RemoteViewerConfig** — Codable config struct with all settings, saved to UserDefaults via AppModel. `Equatable` (the Remote tab editor diffs drafts against it). `mode` (`RemoteViewerMode`) decides which window the profile launches **and where its content comes from** — it used to hinge on `apiEndpoint.isEmpty`, which conflated "no server configured" with "show the app's own gallery":
  - `.slideshow` — RoboFrame server (label "RoboFrame"). An empty endpoint is **refused**, not a fallback (`isLaunchable` / `launchBlockedReason`, enforced in `enqueueRemoteViewerOpen` and the Remote tab's buttons)
  - `.webPage` — pinned website (label "Website")
  - `.appGallery` — slideshow of the app's own content, launched by the tab bar's play button with a transient source override. Excluded from `RemoteViewerMode.userSelectable`, so the Remote tab never offers it: a saved profile can't describe "whatever I'm looking at", which is exactly what made the old blank-endpoint mode unpredictable
  `duplicated(name:)` is the Copy path (copies wholesale — the old hand-enumerated copy had silently drifted); `applyViewerDisplaySettings(from:)` is the viewer write-back merge (see Gallery mode below)
- **RemoteViewerSceneRoot** — the `remote-viewer` scene's root: resolves the profile via `AppModel.remoteViewerConfig(id:)` and builds either `RemoteViewerWindowView` or `WebPageWindowView`. Both modes share the scene, so they also share the open-window registry, the duplicate-open summon path, and the size write-back binding
- **WindowSizePersistence** — shared "remember this window's size across cold relaunches" engine (restore-with-retry against *this* window's scene, plausibility floors on both ends of the round-trip, debounced write-back into the scene archive + a `RestoredWindowTracker` fallback). Extracted from `RemoteViewerWindowView`; both it and `WebPageWindowView` drive the one implementation
- **SlideshowEngine** — `@MainActor @Observable` reusable base class running a state machine (idle → loading → displaying ⇄ paused / backgrounded → stopped). Owns prefetch buffer (3 images ahead), crossfade transitions, Sobel-based Ken Burns focus, dynamic brightness, scene-phase handling, and navigation. Content is preserved across background cycles — the engine has no aggressive unload timer and relies on normal image cycling to bound memory.
- **RemoteViewerModel** — `SlideshowEngine` subclass adding WS integration, save/block, sensor display, Display Sync, and config persistence. Also used as the app's slideshow engine (replaces the old PhotoWindowModel slideshow; `.appGallery` windows use `GalleryContentProvider` for images and `VideoSlideshowContentProvider` for videos)
- **RemoteTabView** — the profile manager. Everything below the profile list is a **draft**: nothing reaches `savedRemoteConfigs` until an explicit Save, and the Editing section names the profile a save would overwrite plus whether the draft still matches it (the matching list row carries an "Editing · unsaved" chip). Save / Revert / **Save as Copy** are separate acts; switching profiles or hitting New with unsaved edits confirms first. If an open viewer window changes the loaded profile, a clean draft silently re-adopts it and a dirty one is flagged with a Reload — a blind save would revert the window's change
- **SlideshowContentProvider** / **RemoteContentProvider** / **GalleryContentProvider** — protocol + implementations that abstract post fetching and image downloading so the engine is agnostic to the source
- **RemoteViewerWindowView** — Main viewer window with image/clock/sensor layers, ornament with auto-hide. Supports both remote API and gallery image sources
- **RemoteAPIClient** — Actor for search/get/save/history HTTP endpoints
- **RemoteWebSocketClient** — `@Observable` class managing a single `URLSessionWebSocketTask` with auto-reconnect. Not owned by a single viewer — acquired from `SlideshowSyncHub`.
- **SlideshowSyncHub** — `@MainActor` singleton providing (1) WS connection pooling keyed by endpoint URL so multiple viewer windows share one connection (RoboFrame server messages broadcast to every subscriber), and (2) local Display Sync broadcast between in-process `RemoteViewerModel` instances (current/next image, prefetched queue, cached posts, cursor, delay — `UIImage` is reference-typed so no bitmap copies)
- **SobelFocusAnalyzer** — Pure functions for Sobel edge detection (Ken Burns focus) and average luminance (dynamic brightness)

**Web page mode (`RemoteViewerMode.webPage`)** pins an arbitrary URL as an interactive panel in the user's space — no slideshow engine, no WebSocket, no content provider. The Remote tab's Mode picker switches the editor between the slideshow sections and a Web Page section (URL, transparent background, auto-refresh).
- **WebPageWindowModel** — per-window `@MainActor @Observable` model that **owns the `WKWebView` for the window's whole lifetime**. That ownership *is* the "retained state" feature: the page keeps its scroll position, logins and in-page JS while the user looks away, because nothing about the WebView depends on SwiftUI view identity. Side-effect-free `init`, `start()` builds + loads, `cleanup()` on dismiss. Also owns nav state for the ornament, the auto-refresh timer, and a nested non-isolated `Delegate` (nav/UI/script-message; separate from the model so `@Observable` stays off NSObject). `target="_blank"` loads in place — a pinned page is one panel, not a browser with tabs.
- **Interaction gate** — the page only accepts input while the ornaments are visible (`webView.isUserInteractionEnabled`, plus `.allowsHitTesting`), because visionOS paints gaze-hover highlights inside web content and that's distracting on a page pinned as decoration. **The reveal target must be a drawn layer in *front* of the page:** a tap gesture on the container *behind* the WebView is never delivered on device — with the page non-interactive, gaze targeting finds nothing in that region and the window goes completely dead. So a `Color.white.opacity(0.001)` catcher (not `.clear` — a fully clear layer isn't gaze-targetable) covers the page while hidden. That catcher is device-confirmed and is the **sole** way back: the ornaments, the window controls (`persistentSystemOverlays`) and any visible affordance are all gone in the hidden state — deliberately, so a pinned page reads as content in the room — so don't remove it without replacing it.
- **Auto-refresh** (`webAutoRefreshInterval`, 0 = off, presets in `RemoteViewerConfig.webAutoRefreshOptions`) is "reload after N seconds of *idleness*": an injected throttled interaction reporter (`pageInteraction` message) restarts the countdown, so a reload never lands mid-form-fill. It also restarts the ornament auto-hide — the ornaments gate input, so letting them hide mid-scroll would yank the page out from under the user's hands. Paused while the window isn't in the current room; on return, a page past its interval refreshes immediately.
- **Transparent background** (`webTransparentBackground`, deliberately *not* the slideshow's `transparentBackground`, which `applySlideshowDefaults` seeds) injects a document-start user script forcing `html`/`body` transparent and sets `isOpaque`/`backgroundColor`/`underPageBackgroundColor` — the last one matters, without it WebKit paints an opaque backdrop derived from the page colour and defeats the CSS. Opaque pages get a `glassBackgroundEffect` backing and rounded corners instead. The WebView's configuration is immutable after creation, so this is read at window-open; editing the profile takes effect on the next launch.

**Slideshow 3D (`Slideshow3DMode`: `.off` / `.spatial3D` / `.immersive3D`)** applies to both media kinds. Images go to `SlideshowSpatial3DLayer` (RealityKit `ImagePresentationComponent`, two slots). **Videos are converted to windowed stereoscopic 3D in real time** whenever a real-time depth model is installed — the slideshow mounts `Pseudo3DVideoPlayerView` with `depthMode: .realtime` in place of the WebKit tiers. Deliberately **never** `.cached`: the pre-processed path writes a depth video per clip to `DepthCache/`, and a slideshow cycles through far too much content to do that; slideshow depth exists only as long as the frame it warps. Because the stereo pump pulls frames from an `AVPlayerItemVideoOutput`, eligibility needs an AVFoundation-decodable source: `SlideshowEngine.resolvePseudo3DTarget` probes the raw URL then the provider's `hlsURL` (the server transcode — WebKit-only WebM/VP9 is reachable only that way) via the shared `NativeVideoDecodeProbe`, memoizing answers in RAM and bounded by a 2s per-candidate timeout. The probe runs *before* the transition so the clip mounts straight into the stereo player instead of painting a flat frame and swapping renderers; it returns without suspending when 3D is off, so the 2D path pays nothing. The resolved `Pseudo3DVideoTarget` is post-id-keyed and read through `activePseudo3DVideoURL`, which re-checks it against the video on screen — so it self-invalidates on every post change with no clearing at the call sites. No model installed, an undecodable source, or `onPlaybackError` → flat playback (`reportPseudo3DVideoFailure`, ignored when it arrives late for a post already gone). Toggling the ornament's 3D mode mid-video re-resolves immediately. Two `Pseudo3DVideoPlayerView` params exist for this caller: `loops` (the slideshow only loops clips shorter than its dwell interval; the video window always loops) and `contentOpacity`, which drives the crossfade through `OpacityComponent` because RealityKit ignores SwiftUI's `.opacity` — routed via the `Animatable` `AnimatableSceneOpacity` modifier so the fade interpolates instead of cutting to black. Adjustments (incl. dynamic brightness) are baked into the warp shader for the same reason.

**RoboFrame Proxy API:**
- `GET {baseURL}/get?id={postId}` → serves image directly (used as img src)
- `GET {baseURL}/save?id={postId}` → saves post, returns status text
- `GET {baseURL}/addtohistory?id={postId}` → adds to viewing history
- There is no `/search` endpoint — the RoboFrame server is the single DuckDB reader. Posts arrive via the WebSocket `playback` channel.

**WebSocket Protocol (JSON, `{ action, payload }`):**
- **Outgoing:** `slideshowConfig {sessionId, deviceId, interval, width, height, bright, convert, lowmem, ratio?}` (sent on connect), `present {deviceId, present}` (slideshow-control — see below), `visibility {deviceId, visible}` (home-location telemetry only → HA motion sensor), `block {id}`, `displaySync {sessionId, enabled}` (claim/release primary), `setModTags {sessionId, tags}`, `requestNext {sessionId}`, `setTagList {sessionId, listNumber}` (per-channel — only the sender's deviceId switches list)
- **Incoming:** `tagLists [[String]]` (server-pushed catalog), `playback {primary, enabled, interval, currentList, modTags, current: {id, ext}, next: {id, ext}}` (active list index lives in `currentList`; there is no standalone `currentTagList` frame any more), `playVideo {url}`, `stopVideo`, `showText {text, bgColorHex, imageUrl}`, `dismissText`, `update {entity, state, attributes}` (HA sensors), `refresh`
- `playVideo`/`showText` open new windows via `openWindow()`; `stopVideo`/`dismissText` dismiss them

**Key implementation details:**
- The server is authoritative on tag list, mod tags, current/next post, and channel timing. Clients render whatever `playback` says and preload the announced `next` via `/get`.
- **No client-side advance in remote mode.** The engine is purely server-driven (`serverDriven` flag set in `start()`): it has no local dwell clock and only ever transitions to a server-pushed `current` (via `setServerCurrent` → `reconcileWithServer`). Advancing locally races the orchestrator and surfaces a prefetched post that ignores the window's advertised ratio (e.g. a wide image in a tall window with fit-to-aspect on). So: **Block** just sends `block` (server drops the post and broadcasts a fresh ratio-appropriate `current`); the **Next button** emits `requestNext` (`advanceToNext()`, the protocol's per-channel advance) rather than `goToNextImage`; the **refresh** frame clears caches and calls `reconcileWithServer` (reload, not advance). `goToNextImage` is gallery-mode only. The exceptions are **Prev** and **history-jump**, which replay already-seen posts or are explicit manual overrides. Never implement a wake-advance (requesting next on returning from background) — the server already owns dwell timing; see protocol.md "no client-side wake-advance". **Fresh image on re-entry** is delivered *server-side*, not by a wake-advance: `present`/`visibility` are split — `RemoteViewerModel.scheduleSceneStateReport(effectiveVisible)` reports both, but only `present` drives the slideshow. While every display on a `deviceId` is absent (`present:false`) the RoboFrame orchestrator does one **dark advance** to a fresh post and parks; on return (`present:true`) the server commits that fresh post and broadcasts it, and the window adopts it through the normal `playback` path (which re-reports `imageReady` on render). So `rejoinReadinessBarrier()` only calls `reconcileWithServer()` — no stale `imageReady` re-send. `visibility` is now pure telemetry (drives the HA motion sensor; no slideshow/`displayState` side effects).
- Ratio filter uses `..` separator (e.g. `ratio:1.32..1.79`), matching server expectations
- Blocked posts/tags from WS `blocked` are merged into local config and persisted
- Save button has 1.5s grace period after image transition (saves previous post)
- Visual adjustments (brightness/contrast/saturation) stack: auto (luminance-based) + per-viewer + global
- Ornament: [ Grid | Prev | Next | Save | Home | Cycle Tags | Display Sync | Adjustments | Block ] (Save/Home/Cycle/Display Sync/Block hidden in gallery mode)
- Adjustments popover has a "Viewer" tab with display toggles (clock, sensors, Ken Burns, background, aspect ratio)
- Images are downsampled on load using `maxImageResolution` from app settings via `CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex`
- **Gallery mode (`.appGallery`):** a slideshow of the app's own content — "whatever I'm looking at". The *profile* is one of two reused slots (`AppModel.gallerySlideshowConfig` / `videoSlideshowConfig`, persisted under their own UserDefaults keys and kept out of `savedRemoteConfigs` so they don't clutter the Remote tab), so ornament tweaks persist between launches; the *content* rides along as a transient override (`pendingGallerySlideshowSource` / `pendingVideoSlideshowSource`) set immediately before the window opens. Entry points all funnel through `AppModel.startGallerySlideshow(imageSource:filter:)` / `startVideoSlideshow(videoSource:filter:)`: the tab bar's play button (Pictures/Videos), the photo viewer's Slideshow button, `LocalFolderBrowserView`'s per-folder slideshow (Albums, browsing Local), and the video viewer's Slideshow button. API-only features (WS, save, block, history, tag cycling) are disabled via `RemoteViewerModel.isGalleryMode`, which tests the **mode** — testing for a `GalleryContentProvider` mislabelled *video* slideshows as remote and left them `serverDriven` with no orchestrator to drive them. A restored `.appGallery` window (from a saved window group, long after the override was consumed) falls back to the app-wide source and filter.
- **Viewer write-back:** ornament/adjustment changes persist through `onConfigChanged` → `AppModel.persistRemoteViewerConfig`, which routes to whichever store owns the profile (saved list vs. the two slideshow slots). The window holds a snapshot from when it opened, so only the viewer-owned display fields are merged onto the current profile (`applyViewerDisplaySettings(from:)`) — writing the snapshot wholesale reverted unrelated edits the Remote tab had saved since
- **Background handling:** On background the engine transitions to `.backgrounded` (pausing the run loop) and remembers `stateBeforeBackground`. Content (current/next image, prefetch queue, cached posts) is preserved locally, but on return the server has dark-advanced to a fresh post (see the `present` split above), so the engine adopts that rather than resuming the stale one. WS present/visibility reporting is immediate. Previously the engine had a 30s unload timer but it was removed — the recovery path from nil content was fragile and the normal cycle already bounds memory.
- **Display Sync:** When the toggle is on, `onPostTransitioned` both sends the WS `displaySync` message (RoboFrame server coordination) and calls `SlideshowSyncHub.broadcastLocalSync` to mirror current/next image, prefetched queue, cached posts, cursor, and delay to every other registered local instance via `RemoteViewerModel.applyLocalDisplaySync`. An `isApplyingIncomingSync` flag suppresses rebroadcast during the crossfade await to prevent feedback loops. Pause/play state is intentionally not mirrored. Shared `TagListManager` already propagates tag list switches across windows so those don't need to ride the sync payload.
- **Shared WS:** All `RemoteViewerModel`s with the same `wsEndpoint` share a single `RemoteWebSocketClient` obtained via `SlideshowSyncHub.subscribeWS`. Each subscriber passes its own `deviceId` to `sendVisibilityChange(deviceId:visible:)`. Server messages (RoboFrame broadcasts for all device IDs by design) fan out to every subscriber; the connection closes when the last subscriber leaves.

## Key Patterns

- MainActor-bound `@Observable` AppModel passed through SwiftUI environment
- Per-window `@Observable` PhotoWindowModel with side-effect-free init (side effects in `start()`)
- Async/await for all network and image generation operations
- Actor-based concurrency for services (ImageLoader, StashAPIClient, LocalMediaSource, SharedMediaCache)
- Protocol-based data sources (`ImageSource`, `VideoSource`) for swappable implementations
- UserDefaults for persisting server config, saved filter views, and display settings
- Explicit resource cleanup in `cleanup()` methods rather than relying on ARC/deinit
- The Xcode project's files are automatically managed, therefore there is no need to update project files when adding new source files. Just create the new .swift file in the appropriate folder and it will be included in the build.

# Testing against Stash: use the dev instance

**Never point tests, simulators or agents at a real Stash server**, not even read-only. `scripts/dev-stash.sh up` runs a disposable Stash in Docker at `http://127.0.0.1:9998` (loopback only, no API key by default), seeded with 12 generated photos and 5 clips covering H.264, 10-bit HEVC 4K and VP9/Opus WebM. The simulators share the Mac's loopback, so configure the app with that URL (in the simulator via `-UITestDefault stashServerURL=http://127.0.0.1:9998`). Use `reset` to re-seed and `rm` to delete it. `scripts/dev-stash.sh auth [user pass]` turns on login for testing the app's API-key path (see "Auth" under tvOS) — the generated key is written to a file, never printed, since it's a live (if disposable) credential.

# Testing the Jellyfin Atmos Objects plugin: use the dev instance

**Never point the plugin, tests or agents at a real Jellyfin server**, same rule as Stash above. `scripts/dev-jellyfin.sh up` runs a disposable Jellyfin 10.11.11 in Docker at `http://127.0.0.1:8097` (loopback only), builds `JellyfinPlugin/Jellyfin.Plugin.AtmosObjects` and installs it, completes the first-run wizard (user `dev`/`dev12345`), creates a Movies library, and mints an API key written to `config/dev-api-key.txt` under `$HYPNOS_DEV_JELLYFIN_DIR` (default `~/.local/share/hypnos-dev-jellyfin`) — chmod 600, never printed. `reset` wipes config/cache and redoes all of that; `down`/`rm` stop it or delete everything.

Seeds a Movies library from `$HYPNOS_DEV_JELLYFIN_DEMO` (default `~/Downloads/DolbyElement4K_VisionAtmos.mkv`, the public Dolby Atmos demo — TrueHD + EAC3/JOC tracks over the same UHD HEVC video) with three items, one per plugin code path:

- The demo itself, bind-mounted read-only — has both tracks, so `AtmosSceneService.GetState` picks TrueHD (see the "Two source formats" note in `JellyfinPlugin/README.md`).
- `DolbyElement-EAC3Only.mkv` — the demo remuxed to drop the TrueHD stream (`ffmpeg -map 0:0 -map 0:2 -c copy`), forcing the plugin onto the EAC3/Cavern path.
- `NoAtmosTest.mkv` — an ffmpeg-generated H.264 + plain (non-JOC) EAC3 5.1 clip, for the "no Atmos objects" → 422/`unsupported` path.

**Naming gotcha, lost an hour to this once:** don't name a seeded item ending in `-clip`, `-sample`, `-trailer` or any other Kodi/Jellyfin "extra" suffix — such a file is filed as an *extra* of some other item instead of a standalone `Movie` and never appears in `/Items` at all, with no error logged anywhere. `NoAtmosTest.mkv`'s name is deliberately plain because of this.

truehdd (`JellyfinPlugin/truehdd/`) only ships a macOS binary, which can't run inside the (Linux) container, so the script also builds a **second, Linux truehdd** — same already-patched checkout, inside a throwaway `rust:1-bookworm` container. Two things about that build are worth knowing if it ever needs touching again:
- **`cargo build --release` reliably gets SIGKILLed** compiling the `truehd` lib crate for `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` at this rustc version (1.98.1) — confirmed independent of `evo-protection`/hmac/sha2, independent of opt-level (1/2/3 all fail), and independent of available memory (still fails at 12 GiB). The same source's release **macOS** build (`truehdd/build.sh`) is unaffected. Looks like an LLVM/rustc backend bug specific to that target at that toolchain version. A plain **debug** build (opt-level 0) compiles fine and is what the script uses — slower than release, but this is only ever used to prove the TrueHD path still works end-to-end, not to measure its speed.
- Even the debug build needs more memory than colima's shared default profile (2 GiB) has, and that profile is shared with other running local containers (dev-stash, etc. — see `~/CLAUDE.md`'s rule on not disturbing other running work). So the script spins up a **second, throwaway colima profile** sized generously (8 GiB) just for this one build, talks to it directly via `DOCKER_HOST=unix://.../docker.sock` (not `docker --context`, which was seen to race and fail right after `colima start` returns), and deletes the profile again afterward. The binary itself is cached on the host at `$root/truehdd/truehdd`, so this whole dance only runs once.
- `colima delete` of that profile leaves docker's current context pointed at the nonexistent `/var/run/docker.sock` instead of restoring `colima` (the default profile's context) — the script explicitly restores it, since every later `docker` call in the script would otherwise fail.

Jellyfin's own startup-wizard endpoints (`/Startup/*`) are flaky for a few seconds right after `/health` first turns 200 and right after `/Startup/Complete` — a `POST /Startup/User` has been seen to 404, and a subsequent `AuthenticateByName` with the exact password just set has been seen denied, in each case only for a few seconds. The script polls `/Startup/Configuration` before starting the wizard and re-verifies (with retry) that the user actually landed before moving on, rather than trusting the first response.

Coordinate mapping and end-to-end verification against this dev instance (TrueHD vs EAC3, elevated-object positions, decode speed) are written up in `JellyfinPlugin/README.md`.

# Stash GraphQL API

You can find the Stash GraphQL API documentation in `internal_docs/Stash_Api_Docs`. **Important:** Claude Code prevents access to this folder while it is in .gitignore, therefore you must temporarily remove it from .gitignore to access the documentation and for your search tool to be able to see it. Undo changes to .gitignore after you are done.
