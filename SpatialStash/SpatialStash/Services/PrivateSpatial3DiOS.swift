import Foundation
import os
import RealityKit

// MARK: - Why this file exists
//
// `ImagePresentationComponent` — RealityKit's 2D→spatial-3D converter and
// presenter, the thing the whole Spatial 3D feature is built on — is declared
// `@available(iOS, unavailable)`. That reads like "does not exist on iPhone",
// and it is the reason `PlatformShims.swift` gives iOS a null object instead.
//
// It is not true at the binary level. Every symbol of the type is exported by
// the iOS build of RealityFoundation and listed in the SDK's own .tbd — 165 of
// them, including `Spatial3DImage.init(contentsOf:)`, `generate()`,
// `init(spatial3DImage:)` and the `ViewingMode` cases. The iPhone plainly runs
// this code already: the Lock Screen's spatial wallpaper and the Photos app's
// spatial scenes are the same conversion, presented with motion parallax
// instead of stereo. What is missing is permission to compile against it, not
// the implementation.
//
// MARK: How the availability is laundered
//
// Swift allows an unavailable declaration to *use* unavailable API — an
// `@available(iOS, unavailable)` function body sees the real type. It just
// cannot be called from available code. So each entry point is written twice:
// once as an unavailable definition that does the work, and once as an
// available `@_silgen_name` declaration bound to the same symbol. The linker
// joins them. No symbol beyond RealityFoundation's own published exports is
// referenced, and nothing here is reachable unless the build defines
// HYPNOS_PRIVATE_API.
//
// MARK: What this actually bought — nothing, and that is the finding
//
// Measured on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, iOS 26. The laundering works: everything
// below compiles, links and runs. The platform then declines in two separate
// places, and between them there is nothing left.
//
//   * **Generation is entitlement-gated.** `Spatial3DImage.generate()` fails
//     with `Missing entitlement: com.apple.modelmanager.inference`. That is an
//     Apple-private entitlement; no third-party profile carries it, and
//     signing it in anyway fails the *install* — `CoreDeviceError 3002` out of
//     `MICodeSigningVerifier`, before the app ever runs.
//
//   * **Presentation has no renderer.** `init(contentsOf:)` on a photo that is
//     already spatial succeeds without touching the model service: it parses
//     the file, reports `mono, spatialStereo, spatialStereoImmersive`, and
//     computes a correct `presentationScreenSize` (0.46 × 1.00 m for a
//     portrait capture). Attached to an entity already in a scene, RealityKit
//     draws the component's screen geometry — right aspect, right rounded
//     corners — filled with the **magenta placeholder material**. Asking for
//     `spatialStereo` silently yields `viewingMode == .mono`, and *mono draws
//     the placeholder too*. Mono is the case that is just "put the picture on
//     the quad", so this is not a missing stereo path; there is no content
//     render path at all on iOS.
//
// So the Lock Screen's spatial wallpaper is not reachable this way. Whatever
// draws it is not this component, or not this component's public geometry.
//
// The one runtime hazard worth remembering if this is ever revisited: reading
// the component **back off** an entity — `entity.components[…​.self]` — jumps
// to address 0 and kills the process with a CODESIGNING / Invalid Page fault.
// `components.set` is fine; it is the read-back that is unbacked. Everything
// here therefore reports out of band (see `lastDiagnostic`) rather than
// consulting the entity.
//
// Kept rather than deleted because the negative result is the expensive part:
// without it the obvious next idea is to try exactly this again.
