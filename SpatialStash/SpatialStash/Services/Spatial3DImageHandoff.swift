/*
 Spatial Stash - Spatial 3D Image Handoff

 In-memory, refcounted handoff of a generated `ImagePresentationComponent.Spatial3DImage`
 between photo windows, so popping a 3D image out of the gallery reuses the already
 generated instance instead of decoding and regenerating from bytes.

 `Spatial3DImage` is a class and `generate()` mutates it in place, so the generated
 state travels with the reference. `PhotoWindowValue` being Codable is irrelevant here
 — it is only an identity token for visionOS; the payload rides in memory, exactly as
 `SharedTextureCache` already does for the 2D MTLTexture.

 Confirmed on device (Apple Vision Pro, visionOS 26.5, 2026-08-24): one instance may
 back two *live* components in two different scenes. The generated state travels with
 the reference (`supportedViewingModes` still reports spatial3D/spatial3DImmersive after
 the crossing, `aspectRatio(for: .spatial3D)` resolves on the second component, and the
 second presents with a non-zero `presentationScreenSize`) with no regeneration, no
 RealityKit error and no crash. `claim` is therefore refcounted rather than a move, so
 "Open Copy" can share one instance between two windows that both stay open.
