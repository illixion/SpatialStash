/*
 Spatial Stash - Remote Notification Sound

 Plays a short audio clip received from RoboFrame as a system alert.
 Uses AudioServices (the alert channel) so the sound mixes with any
 currently-playing video or other apps' media — visionOS doesn't
 interrupt the user's music for a chime.

 Hard-capped at 30 seconds because AudioServices SystemSound APIs
 reject anything longer; we check up front so the rejection is logged
 helpfully instead of failing as a cryptic OSStatus.

 Window-independent: AudioServicesPlayAlertSound runs at the app level,
 so it works regardless of whether any spatialstash window is on
 screen, snapped to a wall, or in the user's current room.
