/*
 Spatial Stash - Native Video Decode Probe

 Shared "can AVFoundation decode this?" check. Being AVFoundation-decodable is
 what unlocks the native Metal player and, with it, real-time fake-3D — the
 stereo pump pulls frames from an `AVPlayerItemVideoOutput`, so a source only
 WebKit can decode (WebM/VP9 on visionOS) has to be routed through a transcode
 first or played flat.

 Used by `VideoWindowModel.resolvePlaybackRenderer` (which renderer to mount)
 and by `SlideshowEngine` (whether a slideshow video can be converted to 3D).
