/*
 Spatial Stash - Photos Library Indexer

 Builds and maintains the local mirror of the photo library.

 The whole design turns on one cost: **filenames are the only expensive part.**
 Everything else about an asset — dates, dimensions, duration, subtypes,
 favourite, album membership — is available from `PHAsset` with no round trip, so
 the whole library can be swept in a second or two. A filename is only reachable
 through `PHAssetResource.assetResources(for:)`, which is an XPC call to
 photolibraryd per asset, with no batch form in the public API. At roughly a
 millisecond each that is a minute of work on a large library.

 So indexing is two passes. The cheap one runs to completion up front and the
 gallery is usable the moment it lands. Filenames are backfilled afterwards at
 utility priority, resumable, and search simply covers more of the library as it
 progresses. Blocking the gallery on the slow pass would have traded a working
 app for a progress bar.

 Incremental sync uses `PHPersistentChangeToken`, which is the API built for
 exactly this: persist a token, ask what changed since, get inserted / updated /
 deleted identifiers directly. No enumerate-and-diff. When the token outlives
 Photos' change history it throws `persistentChangeTokenExpired`, and the only
 answer to that is a full rebuild.
