/*
 Spatial Stash - Welcome Sample

 Resolves the bundled sample photo that the welcome flow converts to 3D.

 It has to be a **file URL**, not a `UIImage`, because that is what
 `ImagePresentationComponent.Spatial3DImage(contentsOf:)` takes — the welcome
 screen runs the real conversion pipeline rather than showing a canned
 before/after, and the real pipeline reads bytes off disk. An asset-catalog
 entry has no URL, so one dropped in that way is re-encoded into the caches
 directory once and served from there.

 Two ways to supply the sample, both looked for here:

   1. A resource file named `WelcomeSample.heic` (or .jpg/.png) anywhere in the
      app target. Preferred — nothing is re-encoded, and a HEIC that already
      carries a depth map converts faster and better.
   2. An asset-catalog image set named `WelcomeSample`.

 With neither present the welcome screen still works: it shows an explanatory
 card in place of the photo and hides the 3D control, which is why every entry
 point here returns an optional rather than trapping. A missing sample must
 degrade the first screen, never break the flow that follows it.
