/*
 Spatial Stash - UI testing configuration

 The app-side half of the XCUITest harness: launch arguments that put persisted
 state into a known shape before anything reads it.

 A UI test cannot reach into the process it drives, so every piece of state a
 test depends on has to be settable from outside. UserDefaults' own argument
 domain very nearly does this — `-someKey 0` in `launchArguments` is picked up
 by `bool(forKey:)` automatically — but only for the typed accessors, and this
 app reads several flags as `object(forKey:) as? Bool` precisely so it can tell
 "never set" from "set to false". That distinction is what decides whether the
 welcome flow appears at all, so the overrides are applied explicitly here
 instead of being left to a bridging coincidence.

 **DEBUG only.** Nothing in this file exists in a release build, which is what
 keeps a shipping app from having launch arguments that rewrite the user's
 settings. XCUITest runs against the Debug configuration, so the tests are
 unaffected.
