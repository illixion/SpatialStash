/*
 Spatial Stash - Slideshow Spatial 3D View

 RealityKit-backed image layer used by the slideshow viewer when
 `Slideshow3DMode` is `.spatial3D` or `.immersive3D`.

 `SlideshowSpatial3DSlotView` is a single slot: it owns one entity with an
 `ImagePresentationComponent`, rebuilds the component when the bound
 `UIImage` changes, and drives `Spatial3DImage.generate()` so the depth
 map is finished before the slot is asked to fade in.

 `SlideshowSpatial3DLayer` is the host the window view embeds — it owns
 two slots and swaps their roles each crossfade so the previously-hidden
 slot (which already finished generating against the prefetched next
 image) just becomes visible instead of regenerating from scratch.
