/*
 Spatial Stash - Slideshow Engine

 Core slideshow engine using a state machine for lifecycle management.
 Handles timer-driven image transitions, prefetching, Ken Burns focus
 analysis, dynamic brightness, navigation, and background lifecycle.

 States: idle → loading → displaying ⇄ paused / backgrounded → stopped

 This is the reusable base class. RemoteViewerModel subclasses it to
 add WebSocket, save/block, sensor display, and display sync features.
 Gallery-mode slideshows can use this class directly.
