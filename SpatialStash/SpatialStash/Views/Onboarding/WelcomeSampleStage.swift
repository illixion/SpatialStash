/*
 Spatial Stash - Welcome Sample

 The bundled sample photo, and the control that converts it to spatial 3D.

 Two views over one model, because the welcome panel puts the picture down the
 left side and the words and controls down the right — so the image and its
 switch are laid out separately and cannot be one view.

 **Flat is a plain SwiftUI image; only 3D mounts RealityKit.** That mirrors what
 the photo viewer does, and it is also the fix for two things the first version
 got wrong on device: a `RealityView` floats its contents about 15cm proud of
 the window plane (a zero-depth slab still gets placed in the middle of the
 window's depth region), and a `RealityView` draws nothing behind its content,
 so the photo appeared to hover with the tab underneath showing through. A flat
 `Image` has neither problem, and nothing about RealityKit is touched until the
 user actually asks for 3D.

 The conversion is the real pipeline — the same `Spatial3DImage.generate()` the
 viewer runs — rather than a crossfade between two baked images. A canned
 before/after is the one thing a first-run screen must not do, since the app has
 to reproduce the result on the user's own photos; watching depth build at this
 device's actual speed is the honest version of the pitch.
