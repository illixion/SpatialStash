/*
 Spatial Stash - Windows Tab

 Inventory of every open window, with Summon and Close on each. The list, the
 rows and the recycle mechanics are RAVEUI's `RAVEWindowManagerView`; this adds
 the app's bulk controls underneath it.

 Summon exists for two reasons: fetching a window snapped in another room, and
 recovering one lost to the visionOS 27 placement bug, where a scene stays
 active and "visible" but is never drawn again (see
 internal_docs/visionos27-invisible-window-feedback.md). Both are fixed the same
 way — destroy the scene, open a fresh one at the user.
