/*
 Spatial Stash - Pseudo 3D Video Player View

 The SwiftUI surface for real-time "fake 3D" video in a normal (Shared Space)
 window. Everything below the view — `Pseudo3DStereoEngine`, `StereoPump`, the
 depth sources and the warp shaders — now lives in `RAVEMedia`, because none of
 it is Spatial Stash-shaped: the browser (Raven) mounts the same engine on
 frames lifted out of a WKWebView instead of an AVPlayer.

 What stays here is what is genuinely this app's: the window-chrome geometry
 constants, the gesture wiring, and the binding of the engine's transport to
 `VideoWindowModel` / `VideoLoopController`.
