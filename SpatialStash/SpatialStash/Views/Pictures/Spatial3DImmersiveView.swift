/*
 Spatial Stash - Spatial 3D Immersive Space

 Mixed-style ImmersiveSpace that hosts a single `ImagePresentationComponent`
 entity for "Fully Immersive 3D" mode. Opened from the photo viewer when
 `AppModel.fullyImmersive3DMode` is on and the user enters Immersive 3D;
 dismissed when they leave it.

 The space owns its own IPC entity so the windowed photo viewer can stay in
 a smaller windowed presentation (or mono) while the immersive presentation
 runs alongside. The image source is identified by `imageURL` — the disk
 cache resolves it to a local file before handing it to
 `ImagePresentationComponent.Spatial3DImage`.

 Placement piggybacks on `SpatialTrackingSession` + `AnchorEntity(.head)`
 with `.once` tracking — same data class as the surface-snapping path
 we already use, no per-app worldSensing prompt. The `.once` tracking
 mode snaps the anchor to the head pose at the moment the space opens
 and then freezes it, which is exactly what we want for a "place this
 in front of where the user is looking" placement.

 Recenter (Digital Crown long-press) is detected via SwiftUI's
 `\.immersiveSpaceDisplacement` environment value — it republishes
 whenever the world origin shifts. On change we tear the head anchor
 down and re-create it, which retriggers the `.once` snap against the
 new pose.
