/*
 Spatial Stash - Accessibility identifiers

 **This file is a member of both the app target and `SpatialStashUITests`.**

 That is unusual here — every other source file is picked up automatically by
 the synchronized folder group, and this one is referenced explicitly in
 `project.pbxproj` instead — and it is the point of the file. A UI test target
 shares no module with the app it drives, so identifiers otherwise have to be
 written out twice, and the copy in the test target silently rots the first time
 the app's is edited. One file in two targets is the only arrangement where the
 identifier a test matches on and the identifier the view carries cannot drift.

 Shared components (the tab bar, the window inventory) form their own
 identifiers in `RAVEA11y`, which both targets reach through RAVEUI. What lives
 here is only what is specific to this app.

 Anything a UI test needs to find gets an identifier rather than being matched
 on its label: labels are display copy, and the app is mid-rename.
