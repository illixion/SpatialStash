/*
 Spatial Stash UI tests - the shared tab bar and window inventory

 Both of these views live in RAVESDK's `RAVEUI`, not in this app, and this file
 is where they get driven for real. A Swift package cannot host XCUITest —
 there is no UI-testing product type, and the harness needs an app to attach to
 — so the package's own `RAVEUITests` covers the arithmetic and bookkeeping and
 the views are exercised here, in the app that embeds them. Anything that fails
 in this file is a bug report against the SDK, not against Spatial Stash.

 The identifiers come from `RAVEA11y`, which both the SDK and this target link,
 so there is nothing to keep in sync by hand: a tab is `rave.tab.<name>` and
 this app passes its enum case names, which survive the display-copy rename the
 titles will not.
