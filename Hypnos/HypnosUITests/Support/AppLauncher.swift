/*
 Hypnos UI tests - launching the app in a known state

 Every test starts from a wiped defaults domain and states the flags it depends
 on, because a UI test that inherits the simulator's leftover state passes or
 fails for reasons that have nothing to do with the code. The arguments are
 read by the app's `UITestingConfiguration`; the names are shared, not copied
 (see `AccessibilityIdentifiers.swift`, which is a member of both targets).

 Everything else here is waiting. XCUITest's default `exists` is a snapshot and
 an app that is still launching, or a view still mid-transition, has not drawn
 the element yet — so the helpers wait rather than assert, and the assertion is
 about what was found.
