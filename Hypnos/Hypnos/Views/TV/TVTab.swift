/*
 Hypnos - tvOS top tab bar

 The tvOS root is a completely separate UI from the visionOS ornament and the
 iOS `TabView` — see `Hypnos/CLAUDE.md` "tvOS". This is its own small tab
 enum rather than an extra case on the shared `Tab` (Model/Tab.swift):
 that type is keyed to `RAVEA11y`/`RAVETabItem` and to the visionOS/iOS
 ornament's developer-tab visibility rules (Remote, Console), none of which
 tvOS needs — Settings, Console and Remote are folded into one Settings tab
 here, and there is no Filters or Windows tab at all (no multi-window
 concept on tvOS, and nothing yet to filter Photos/Stash by on a 10-foot
 remote-driven grid).
