/*
 Hypnos - tvOS Photos library empty state

 The Pictures/Videos tabs' "nothing to show" message when the Photos library
 source is in force. Mirrors the spirit of `PhotoLibraryStateView`
 (visionOS/iOS, `Views/MediaLibraryStateView.swift`) but without any of its
 touch UI — no inline server-connect form, nothing keyboard-shaped — since
 none of that reads well from six feet with a Siri Remote. tvOS keeps almost
 nothing locally, so an Apple TV that has never had iCloud Photos turned on
 is the common case, not an edge case: the message says exactly where to
 enable it (Settings → Users and Accounts → iCloud) rather than assuming the
 user knows this is even a per-device toggle.
