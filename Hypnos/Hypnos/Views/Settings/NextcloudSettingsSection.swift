/*
 Hypnos - Nextcloud Settings Section

 Connect a Nextcloud server and choose which folder its library reads from.

 Sign-in is Login Flow v2: the user approves in the server's own web login, so
 the app never handles the account password and 2FA / SSO work unchanged. What
 comes back is a per-device app password, revocable from the server's
 Settings → Security under the name in `loginUserAgent` below.

 The root is a dropdown of the server's actual folders rather than a text
 field, because a typed path can only be guessed at and a wrong guess reads as
 an empty library rather than an error. It matters more than it looks: an
 unscoped search returns every image the account can see, which on a server
 that also hosts music means thousands of album-art JPEGs mixed into the
 photos.
