/*
 Hypnos - Media Library State Views

 The screens shown in place of a grid when there is nothing to draw, shared by
 the Pictures and Videos tabs so both read as one family.

 Three photo-library states need saying out loud, and which of them carries an
 action is the whole point:

   * Undecided — offers the prompt, because the user has not been asked yet.
   * Denied or restricted — sends them to Settings, the only place it can change.
   * Readable but empty — NO action, because there is nothing to fix. A
     `.limited` grant with nothing selected is a legitimate choice, not a
     failure, and offering a button there implies the user did something wrong.

 A fourth state is not about permission at all: readable, non-empty, but the
 active filter matches nothing. That one *does* carry an action, because the
 cause is something the user set and can unset — and without it a filtered-out
 library is indistinguishable from an empty one, which reads as the app having
 lost the photos.
