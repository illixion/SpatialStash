 Hypnos - Media Thumbnail

 A square thumbnail for any media URL the app can resolve.

 One view for every place a small preview is needed — filter chips, filter option
 rows, album covers — because `ImageLoader.loadThumbnail(from:)` already handles
 all three URL shapes involved: a synthetic `photos-asset:///` URL, a container
 file, and a server thumbnail. A per-source thumbnail view would be describing a
 difference that does not survive contact with the loader.

 **Decoded thumbnails are cached in memory, and read synchronously on the first
 render.** That is not an optimization, it is what stops a visible flash.
 `ContentView` keys tab content on `selectedTab`, so every tab switch destroys
 and rebuilds the whole view tree; each thumbnail's `@State` goes with it and
 every cover reloads from nothing. A grid of placeholder tiles appearing and then
 filling in, over the tab crossfade, is exactly the "light flash" that leaving an
 album produced. Loading in a `.task` cannot fix it either — a task runs *after*
 the first frame, so even a warm cache would paint one placeholder frame. Reading
 the cache in `init` means a revisited grid draws its covers immediately.

 With no URL and no placeholder symbol it renders nothing at all, so a chip for a
 dimension that has no covers lays out exactly as it would without one.
