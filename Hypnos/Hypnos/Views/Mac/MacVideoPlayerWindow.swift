 Hypnos - macOS video player window

 The `video-detail` window's content: a direct `NSViewRepresentable` wrapping
 AppKit's `AVPlayerView` (the seam this app's macOS UIKit-gap notes call for),
 which gives the platform's own transport UI for free — the Mac equivalent of
 `TVVideoPlayerView`'s "reach for the platform's own player chrome rather than
 porting `VideoControlBar`" choice, and the same reasoning: none of
 `VideoWindowView`'s ornament/fake-3D/adjustments machinery is Mac-shaped.

 Wraps `AVPlayerView` directly rather than going through SwiftUI's `VideoPlayer`
 (which wraps the same class internally): `VideoPlayer` crashed at launch on
 this Xcode 27 / macOS 26 pairing with "failed to demangle superclass of
 VideoPlayerView from mangled name 'So12AVPlayerViewC'" — a Swift runtime
 metadata bug in SwiftUI's own wrapper, reproduced consistently. Going one
 layer down to the AppKit class directly avoids whatever synthesized type
 trips it.

 Follows the same two moves every other AVFoundation path in the app makes
 before opening a URL — see `TVVideoPlayerView`'s doc comment for the reasons
 in full:

 1. **Auth** — every URL goes through `MediaAuthorization`.
 2. **Stream-URL strategy** — `NativeVideoDecodeProbe` decides native vs.
    Stash's HLS transcode (VP9 is registered as a supplemental decoder at
    launch on macOS too — see `HypnosApp.init` — so VP9-in-MP4 may decode
    natively; VP9-in-WebM still needs WebKit, which isn't wired up on macOS
    this pass, so it falls to the transcode same as tvOS).

 A `photos-asset:///` identity (Photos library source) resolves through
 `PhotosAssetStore` first, same as everywhere else.
