// macOS has no `UIApplicationDelegate`/scene-session machinery — a `Window`/
// `WindowGroup` scene maps straight to a real `NSWindow`, there is no
// "restore a scene, then decide whether to summon a main window" dance (a
// closed Mac window is just gone, and Cmd+N/the Dock icon already reopen one
// the ordinary AppKit way), and this app doesn't yet route macOS's windows
// through `RAVEWindowSessionRegistry` (see Hypnos/CLAUDE.md "macOS" — a known
// gap, not a port of this file's visionOS/iOS logic). What does carry over
// unchanged is the one-time app-launch housekeeping: local media directories
// and the shared-media cache exist on every platform.
