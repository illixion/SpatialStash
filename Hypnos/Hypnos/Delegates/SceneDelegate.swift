// `WindowGroup` scene maps straight to a real `NSWindow`, with no delegate
// object in between. The scene-lifecycle logging and `windowScene` tracking
// below are meaningless there (and already no-ops for window-geometry
// purposes — see `PlatformWindowScene` in `Support/PlatformShims.swift`), but
// `@Environment(SceneDelegate.self)` is read from several shared views, so
// macOS gets a minimal stand-in that only carries the cross-platform static
// pieces (the incoming-shared-URL backlog) that `IncomingURLHandler` needs on
// every platform.
