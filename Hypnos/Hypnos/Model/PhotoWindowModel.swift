/*
 Hypnos - Photo Window Model

 Per-window model for individual photo display windows.
 Each photo window gets its own instance with independent state.

 Memory strategy: Windows open in lightweight 2D mode using a downsampled
 UIImage via SwiftUI Image. RealityKit (full resolution) is only loaded when
 the user explicitly activates 3D. On window resize, the 2D display image
 is re-downsampled in memory (no temp files on disk).
