/// Surfaces the system's local-network access prompt ahead of the first real
/// LAN request, so that request succeeds instead of failing against an
/// undetermined permission.
///
/// There is no public API to *query* or *request* local-network access, so the
/// only lever is to touch something that needs it and let the system prompt.
/// `ProcessInfo.processInfo.hostName` is the cheapest such thing: it resolves
/// the device's own name over mDNS.
///
/// Two properties of that call are the whole reason this type exists:
///
/// - **It is synchronous and it blocks until the user answers.** While the
///   permission is undetermined the resolution stalls, and the calling thread
///   stalls with it — potentially for as long as the alert is on screen.
/// - **The alert is presented on the app's own window scene.** So blocking the
///   main thread from `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`, before any scene has
///   connected, deadlocks: no scene means no alert, no alert means the call
///   never returns, and the app sits on a black screen. Backgrounding and
///   returning breaks the tie only because it gives UIKit a chance to attach
///   the scene behind the stuck launch. visionOS's scene lifecycle happens to
///   dodge this; iOS does not.
///
/// So the prewarm runs **off the main thread** and **only once the UI is
/// already on screen**, and only for users who actually have a LAN-dependent
/// feature configured — a Photos-only user should never see the prompt.
