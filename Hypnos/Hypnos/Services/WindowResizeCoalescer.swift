//
//  WindowResizeCoalescer.swift
//  Hypnos
//
//  One window's geometry requests, deduplicated.
//
//  visionOS has no window-*position* API: `requestGeometryUpdate` carries a
//  size and the system decides where the resized window ends up. So every
//  granted resize is also a move the app cannot undo, and the cost is paid in
//  full by the pushed photo viewer — `pushWindow` swaps content inside the
//  gallery's own scene, so each request the viewer makes walks the grid window
//  around the room.
//
//  The viewer computes the same target size from several independent triggers
//  (branch appearance, aspect-ratio change, load completion, end of a swipe,
//  and a delayed verification pass) because any one of them can be the one
//  that first knows the final aspect ratio. They are not redundant as
//  *triggers* — they are redundant as *requests*. This forwards the first and
//  drops the restatements.
//
//  The test for "that one already landed" is deliberately **not** "the window
//  is now the size I asked for". A requested size and the scene geometry that
//  comes back are not in the same coordinate space — the scene is larger than
//  the SwiftUI content the sizes are computed from by the window's chrome
//  insets, which is the same mismatch documented in `WindowSizeNudge` as the
//  cause of a size ratchet. Comparing across the two would make every grant
//  look wrong and suppress nothing.
//
//  What is compared instead is the scene geometry against itself: the window's
//  size is sampled just before each request is sent, and a restatement is
//  dropped only when the window has moved since. If the window has *not*
//  changed since the last identical request, the request either did nothing or
//  was dropped by the system — the two are indistinguishable from here, so it
//  goes through. That is what keeps every existing retry path working
//  (scene-restoration stomps, dropped requests during window placement) while
//  still collapsing the burst of identical requests that one image open fires.
//
