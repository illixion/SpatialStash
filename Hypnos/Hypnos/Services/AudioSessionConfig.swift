 Hypnos - Audio Session Configuration

 Central audio-session setup. The app uses a mixable playback category so its
 videos never steal audio focus from other apps (music, other players) on
 visionOS — videos start muted, and even when unmuted they mix rather than
 interrupt.

 Without this, AVPlayer-backed players (native Metal, fake-3D) inherit the
 default `.soloAmbient` category, which interrupts other audio the moment a
 clip with an audio track begins — even while muted. WebKit manages its own
 mixable session, which is why only the native path exhibited the interruption.

 The per-player and per-item *spatial-audio* policies that used to live here
 moved to RAVEMedia (`RAVESpatialAudio.swift`) — the stereo engine applies them
 to every player it creates. This session category stayed: it is a whole-app
 decision about audio focus, not a property of one player.
