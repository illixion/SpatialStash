/*
 Hypnos - Window Size Persistence

 Remembers a pop-out window's user-chosen size across cold relaunches and
 re-asserts it when visionOS restores the window at the scene `.defaultSize`.

 Extracted from RemoteViewerWindowView so the pinned web-page window gets the
 same behaviour (both are wall-snapped, long-lived windows whose size the user
 tunes once and expects to stick). Every guard here exists because of a real
 failure — see the comments before loosening any of them.
