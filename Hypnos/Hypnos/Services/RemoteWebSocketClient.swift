/*
 Hypnos - Remote WebSocket Client

 Real-time control, sensor data, and cross-device synchronization with the
 RoboFrame server.

 The connection-management core — ephemeral session, exponential backoff,
 keepalive, NWPathMonitor wake, probe-on-wake, suspend/revive — now lives in
 `RAVEWebSocketTransport`, shared with Spatial Home's Home Assistant client
 (which adapted most of it from here in the first place, then drifted).

 What stays here is everything RoboFrame-shaped: the `{action, payload}`
 framing, session multiplexing, the presence/visibility scene state machine,
 and the replay that has to happen after every reconnect. In particular
 **readiness is declared from here**, on the first inbound frame — the
 transport has no opinion about when a socket becomes usable, because Spatial
 Home promotes on a parsed `auth_ok` instead.
