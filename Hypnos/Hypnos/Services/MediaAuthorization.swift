/*
 Hypnos - Media Authorization

 Maps a media server's host to the credential that authenticates requests to
 it, so "how do I attach auth to this URL" has one answer instead of a
 `?apikey=` literal hand-copied into every consumer.

 Stash and Nextcloud need genuinely different mechanisms — a query parameter
 the server itself already bakes into most URLs it hands back, versus a Basic
 `Authorization` header that has no query-string equivalent — so the type this
 resolves to is a small enum rather than a single "auth token" string, and
 each consumer asks for the *shape* it can use (a full `URLRequest`, bare
 header fields for `AVURLAsset`, or a query-decorated `URL` for a caller that
 can only hand WebKit a `src` attribute).
