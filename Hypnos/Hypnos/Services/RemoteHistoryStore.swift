/*
 Hypnos - Remote History Store

 Shared cache of the RoboFrame server's /history.json response, scoped to
 a single endpoint URL. Multiple viewer windows pointed at the same server
 read the same store, so opening the history grid in any one of them
 doesn't re-trigger a fetch the others have already done.

 Refresh policy: on app launch (eagerly per saved config) and on each
 press of the history button. The server's history is a small rolling
 window kept in RAM, so a polling/observer setup would be overkill.
