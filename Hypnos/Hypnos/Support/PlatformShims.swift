/*
 Hypnos - iOS/tvOS compatibility layer

 The app was written for visionOS first, and a handful of visionOS-only SwiftUI
 and RealityKit APIs are used from dozens of files: ornaments, glass backgrounds,
 z-offsets, `ImagePresentationComponent`, the spatial-audio policy. Rather than
 sprinkle `#if os(visionOS)` through every view, this file gives iOS a same-name
 stand-in for each of them with the closest flat-screen meaning:

 - `.ornament(...)`            → an overlay pinned to the matching edge, in a
                                 horizontal scroller when it is wider than the
                                 screen (a phone in portrait is narrower than
                                 any of the viewer bars).
 - `.glassBackgroundEffect()`  → iOS 26 Liquid Glass (`.glassEffect`).
 - `.offset(z:)`               → no-op; there is no depth axis.
 - `ImagePresentationComponent`→ a null-object RealityKit component: every
                                 query answers "mono / unsupported", and both
                                 `Spatial3DImage` initialisers throw. The photo
                                 model's 3D paths therefore compile unchanged
                                 and simply fail closed. The UI never offers
                                 them on iOS (see `PlatformCapabilities`).
 - `applySpatialAudioPolicy()` → no-op; head-tracked spatial audio is a
                                 visionOS window-placement concern.

 That `#if !os(visionOS)` section is compiled on **iOS and tvOS both** — tvOS
 inherits the iOS stand-ins wherever they still make sense (the null-object
 `ImagePresentationComponent`, the audio no-ops, `.offset(z:)`). Where tvOS
 needs something genuinely different — a real `.ornament` has no remote-driven
 equivalent, `.popover` doesn't exist at all — a further `#if os(tvOS)` /
 `#else` split appears inline, so the iOS behaviour above is unchanged.
 tvOS's *real* UI lives in `Views/TV/` and doesn't route through most of these
 shims at all (see Hypnos/CLAUDE.md "tvOS"); they exist so the rest of the
 shared module — which tvOS still compiles as one target — keeps building.

 `WindowGeometry` and `PlatformCapabilities` at the bottom are the things that
 exist on all three platforms: shared code calls them, and each platform
 supplies its own answer.
